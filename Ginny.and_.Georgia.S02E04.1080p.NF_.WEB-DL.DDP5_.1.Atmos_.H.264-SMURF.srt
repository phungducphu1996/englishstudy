Ginny.

37
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,669
- Shit. Get in the closet.
- Shit.

38
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,213
Okay, uh…

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,676
Marcus.

40
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:25,770
You're up.

41
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,355
It's only 9:00 p.m.

42
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,983
I forgot to pick up
our birth control from CVS.

43
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,111
- Be a peach and run out and grab it.
- You can't grab it tomorrow morning?

44
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,155
Oh, yeah, that's fun.

45
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,615
Let's play fast and loose
with our birth control.

46
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,578
Remind me of our age difference again?
It's one, two… fifteen years?

47
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,872
Come on, move your butt.

48
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,594
Marcus, are you in the closet?

49
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,471
Yeah.

50
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,558
Are you decent?

51
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,269
No.

52
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,272
Get dressed and come out here, please.

53
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,569
Hi there!

54
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,486
Hi.

55
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,990
- I'm gonna go.
- How long you been dating my daughter?

56
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,286
We're not, like, dating. It's, um…

57
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,370
Hmm.

58
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,539
I didn't like that answer.

59
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,292
- No, I really like her.
- You like her?

60
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,420
- I love her.
- You love her?

61
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,006
Yeah, I do.

62
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,011
Have a seat.

63
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,559
Mm.

64
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,271
You're a damaged kid, aren't you?

65
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,608
It's okay. I know.

66
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,777
I'm damaged too.

67
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,991
Ginny is special.

68
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,620
She's gonna go off
and do big, wonderful things.

69
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,623
And I realized something recently.

70
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,043
She doesn't know it yet, but one day,

71
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,755
when she figures out that our damage
is holding her back, she's gonna leave us.

72
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,007
And I'm not being cruel.

73
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,593
Well, maybe I'm being cruel,

74
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,263
but… I'm being honest.

75
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,850
You're her high school love,
and that is fine.

76
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,602
That's sweet, that's swell, pin her.

77
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,355
Take her to sock hop, or whatever.

78
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,985
But when the time comes,
if you really love her,

79
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,654
don't hold her back.

80
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,199
Hey.

81
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,451
Promise me.

82
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,750
Yeah, I promise.

83
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,380
And if you get her pregnant,
I'll kill you.

84
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,678
Mom, the pharmacy said
that you picked it up this morning.

85
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:07,974
What is this?

86
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:11,144
Oh, Marcus stopped by for a smoke
on his way out of your closet.

87
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,188
Mm, so this is the trust thing
we were talking about?

88
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,690
You tell me.

89
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,692
Were you gonna share
that your secret boyfriend

90
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,152
was sneaking through your window?

91
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,363
- He's not my boyfriend...
- Yeah, now's the time for semantics.

92
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,907
Sneaking a boy through a window.
Am I trapped in a '90s show?

93
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,493
What is this?
<i>Clarissa Explains It All</i>? <i>Dawson's Creek</i>?

94
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,995
What's next episode?

95
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,664
Someone have a mental breakdown
or hook up with a teacher?

96
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,791
I'm definitely tuning in.

97
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,589
I'm gonna get out of here, uh…

98
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,802
Yeah, this is, uh…
this is really fit mothering.

99
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,768
Food stamps are 210 a month.
I only make 250.

100
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,810
Rent is 500.

101
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,271
That brings us back to the conversation
about my electric bill,

102
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,398
and I promise you,
not even Benjamin Franklin

103
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,692
wanted to talk this much
about electricity.

104
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,781
I've been transferred three times.

105
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,491
Okay? I'm tired.

106
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,201
Please don't transfer.

107
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,168
You can't turn it off
if my kid is sick, right?

108
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,419
It's a law.

109
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,017
You hear that?

110
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,353
Another month.

111
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,313
Thank you.

112
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,539
How about this?

113
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,041
I won't be mad you've been sneaking
a boy through the window

114
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,377
if you're not mad
that I smoked with that boy.

115
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,090
Come on, I want us to be okay.

116
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,720
- What did you guys talk about?
- Patriots are nothing without Brady.

117
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,013
Mom.

118
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,182
I wanted to know how he felt about you.

119
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,059
And?

120
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,271
He's in love with you.

121
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,732
He's got good taste,
I'll give him that.

122
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,903
- I just wish you'd told me about him.
- Well, I'm sorry I'm not perfect.

123
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,738
Yeah, well, neither am I.

124
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,240
Yeah, no kidding.

125
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,158
Hey.

126
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,622
What?

127
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,999
Um…

128
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,543
Do you remember...

129
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:45,047
What's the thing with the…
with the balls?

130
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,924
With the what?

131
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:51,721
One time, you said that
there was a trick with, um…

132
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,348
…with balls.

133
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,893
Are you asking me how to give a blow job?

134
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:58,519
Yeah.

135
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,063
After you just yelled at me
for not being a fit mother?

136
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,567
Okay.

137
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:09,906
So you wanna apply pressure
to the bottom with one hand.

138
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,202
- Uh, what do I do with my other hand?
- Just kind of…

139
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,164
Maybe we need a banana.

140
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,000
- Wait. I know. Let me get my vibrator.
- Don't get your vibrator.

141
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,839
So it's Marcus, huh?

142
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,759
Mr. Weed smoking, breaking and entering,

143
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,470
"first time I touch my bike,
I crash into a tree" Marcus?

144
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,722
- That's the guy?
- He's much more than that.

145
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,016
Mm-hmm. Clearly.
He also likes getting head.

146
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,894
He's actually a really talented artist.

147
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,563
Mm-hmm. True Renaissance man.

148
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,525
He take you on dates,
or he just sneaks in at night?

149
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,568
Mom, stop, okay? Just trust me.

150
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,947
- Okay.
- Tomorrow's his birthday.

151
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,158
Very nice.

152
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,284
Very literal.

153
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,288
Good, good.

154
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,749
Whoo! Weird night.

155
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,920
No more secrets, Peach.

156
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,006
That's the only way this works, okay?

157
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,342
Yeah.

158
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,971
This is good.

159
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,097
We're good now.

160
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,016
The air's all been cleared, right,
with everything?

161
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,562
Yes. Yeah, we're good. I'm good.

162
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,357
If anything,
we're closer than ever.

163
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,692
Us against the world.

164
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,237
Yeah, Mom, I know.

165
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,072
Okay.

166
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:34,865
Good.

167
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:55,761
Okay, coffee maker in the house.

168
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,930
Is that the last of it?

169
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,892
Uh, well, you would think that,
but you would be wrong.

170
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,605
I do not know how I have that much crap.

171
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,358
Hey, Ginny.

172
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,112
You think you and Austin
can stay at Zion's this Friday?

173
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:16,616
Paul and I are gonna crash at his condo
after we finish cleaning it out.

174
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,618
- This Friday? Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

175
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,913
My freedom. It's the end of an era.

176
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:27,668
So, family, I have to throw a party for
my initiation to the Neighborhood Club.

177
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,378
What do we think? What's my theme?

178
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,006
- Has to have a theme?
- What household were you raised?

179
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,050
There's opportunity for theme,
you take it.

180
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,551
What's the theme of your wedding?

181
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,179
Oh, well, I stand corrected,
wedding themes are tacky.

182
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,556
- The theme of our wedding is wedding.
- And love.

183
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,433
Yeah.

184
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,479
I wanna throw the best party
in the history of parties.

185
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,648
Babe, it's going to be great.

186
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,025
Yeah, babe.

187
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,026
Yeah, babe.

188
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,820
You're all a bunch of assholes.

189
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,493
Is that what you're wearing?

190
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,040
Couldn't let me leave the house
without making one comment, could you?

191
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,750
No, I like it.

192
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,462
It's very "I'm the new vampire
who just drove into Sunnydale."

193
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,005
Edgy.

194
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,967
Okay. Yeah, no, Paul, if you ever
need to unwind from all of this,

195
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,262
just hit me up.
Maybe you and I can go smoke out.

196
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,516
If this is a cry for help, it's very loud.

197
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,020
Does she seem okay to you?

198
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,190
Yeah. I mean, she seems fine.
You two seem back to normal.

199
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,818
- I mean, normal for the two of you.
- Hmm.

200
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:37,363
But what was up
with the "smoke out" comment?

201
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,074
She's teasing me.
We had a little incident last night.

202
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,368
I caught Marcus Baker
climbing through her window.

203
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,870
- Her window? In this house?
- Mm-hmm.

204
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,832
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, so, what are we gonna do?

205
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,668
Send her to boarding school
in Switzerland?

206
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,963
- No, Georgia, I'm serious.
- No, I know, me too.

207
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,631
I don't know. I'll take care of it.

208
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,717
Okay, you take care of it.

209
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,844
Mom, we're gonna be late.

210
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,470
Okay.

211
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,888
- Bye, buddy.
- Let's go.

212
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,098
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

213
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:08,561
Hey, real quick. How did the meeting
with Austin's teacher go?

214
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,938
Oh, she wants to put him
on some kind of plan.

215
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,023
I have to meet
with the guidance counselor.

216
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,359
I don't know.
Doesn't matter, I'm not doing it.

217
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,403
Why not? If she recommends it, then it's...

218
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,155
Well, he just needs to study harder.

219
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,867
- Maybe, but...
- Well, I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

220
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,618
I'll see you at work. I love you.

00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,471
I just wanted to say
happy birthday.

238
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,973
Thanks, Sophie. That's really nice.

Oh, I'm… I' good. Yeah. How are you?

Great. Having the best birthday.

242
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,402
You should come to my party on Friday.
It's at Brodie's basement.

243
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,446
As friends, obviously.

244
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,532
And you could bring someone,

245
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,660
like a friend or a date.
It wouldn't matter to me.

246
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,662
Uh, yeah, maybe.

247
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,664

00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,016
- What was that last night?
- She just knew I was there.

253
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,687
She's Georgia, she knows everything.
She has no boundaries.

254
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,106
Expect that shit from her.
Welcome to my life.

255
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,023
I'm sorry.

256
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,401
- What'd you guys talk about?
- Nothing.

257
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,153
Just what my intentions are
with her daughter.

258

I said I intend to destroy you.

Don't smoke with my mom again.

I can't believe
I have to say that sentence.

Happy birthday.

263
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,839
You tend to confuse
the days of the week, so…

264
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:46,927
Okay.

265
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,265
Glad you like it.

266
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:53,851
I love it. Thanks.

267
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:54,894
There's more.

268
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,605
Um, my mom and Paul
are gonna be at Paul's this Friday,

269
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,316
so my house will be empty.

270
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,360
Yo, Maxine's a bitch.

271
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,946
- "Birthday."
- Thank you.

272
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,781
What you doing right now?
What class you have?

273
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,491
Um, I have AP English.

274
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,495
- Wanna skip? Hmm?
- Haven't you been skipping a lot?

275
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,415
Why don't you go smoke with my mom
and tell on me?

276
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:28,886
Hey, come in.

277
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,055
City's website is live.

278
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:36,852
"I will continue to be a tireless advocate
for Wellsbury residents."

279
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,312
You didn't run this by me?

280
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,689
- No, I didn't.
- You like it?

281
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:45,319
It's very dry.
Where's the mention that you're engaged?

282
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:48,072
- It's not<i> People </i>magazine.
- The picture is of City Hall.

283
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,323
That is where we work.

284
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,951
- It should be of you, you're hot.
- Nobody cares about that.

285
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,786
- Yes, they do.
- Yes, they do.

286
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,079
I can help fix this.

287
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,122
We need a social media presence
to humanize you.

288
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,917
- An account run by the mayoress.
- Still not a thing.

289
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,878
Nick, you know I'm right.
Paul's charismatic. He's good-looking.

290
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,713
Okay, starting to feel like
a piece of meat.

291
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,216
He's got Beto energy. Obama energy.

292
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,301
Oh, oh yes, he's exactly like Obama,

293
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,388
a Black man who worked his way
to the highest office in the world.

294
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,598
The very same.

295
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,642
Socials aren't a bad idea.
We could hire someone.

296
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,477
Why won't you let me help?

297
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,145
I could ask you the same thing.

298
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:27,069
What Steinbeck is doing here
is making a clear connection

299
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:32,366
between the importance of redemption
in order to survive spirituality.

300
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,994
You see, the family manages to survive

301
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,413
and perform an act of kindness,

302
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,958
showing that they have not lost
their sense of decency.

303
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,210
So if you put that into context…

304
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,050
Got up at 6:00 a.m.

305
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:55,139
I raided Party City,
and I even used glitter glue.

306
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,807
She's being such a mean girl.

307
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,309
She'll get over it.

308
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,729
She's mad that we weren't
being good friends,

309
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,022
but she's not being good to us.

310
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,608
I feel like she would freak out
if she knew that we were all hanging out.

311
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,490
- Wanna take a picture?
- I think I do.

312
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:14,950
Let's do it.

313
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,621
- Get in this.
- No, uh…

314
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,755
This dance is pivotal, okay?
We just met Josephine.

315
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,797
Independent.

316
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,800
Marriage? Absolutely not.

317
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:37,723
And we met the duke,
you know, lone wolf, anti-establishment.

318
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,350
And then they meet each other.

319
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,773
And then, oh, Josephine realizes
she has feelings for the duke.

320
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,942
The duke realizes
he has feelings for Josephine.

321
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,237
They pretend… they don't.

322
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,032
And it goes…

323
00:17:55,741 --> 00:18:01,955
Carriage up, and turning, box, two, three.

324
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,501
Promenade, twinkle step, and close.

325
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,088
Here.

326
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:10,839
Okay.

327
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:12,883
Carriage up.

328
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,138
Sorry.

329
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,349
Uh, he lost me at "promenade."

330
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,312
- Uh, Max, you wanna come here?
- Yeah.

331
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,275
- Do you mind putting your arm down?
- Yes. Sorry.

332
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,736
It's my birthday.
I'm very popular and beloved.

333
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,947
Ooh, happy birthday.

334
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,533
Thank you.
Happy my birthday to you.

335
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,286
Actually, you should totally come
to my party on Friday.

336
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,956
It's at Brodie's basement.
Whole cast and crew's invited.

337
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,333
Yeah? Uh, maybe.

338
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,710
Hey, will my costume have cleavage?

339
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,963
You'll like it, I promise.

340
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,090
I have this whole steampunk

341
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,802
meets Victorian high society concept
for the whole show.

342
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,139
- Okay, that sounds amazing.
- Doesn't it sound so good?

343
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,849
Yes. I'm so impressed.

344
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,605
Actually, I've always
really noticed your style.

345
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,984
- Really?
- Yeah. Oh, I love your whole look.

346
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,402
Thanks.

347
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,613
You too. I love your shirt.

348
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,366
Um, turn around.

349
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,456
- Hey.
- Hey.

350
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,335
Sorry I'm late. Did Joe notice?

351
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,503
- He's not here.
- Okay.

352
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,046
Hey, Marcus.

353
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:33,964
Hey.

354
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,221
What? We steal coffee, like, all the time.

355
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,182
See ya.

356
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,727
How's that going?

357
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,981
Um, it's… it's good.

358
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,608
Is he your boyfriend?

359
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,153
- Um…
- Yeah, sounds about right.

360
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,657
Hey, what, uh… what sociopath orders
a gingerbread latte?

361
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,994
- That sounds vile. Mmm.
- It is. I had it this morning. Gross.

362
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,331
Oh my God. Joe.

363
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,666
What happened to your face?

364
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,959
What?

365
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,797
Okay, yeah, uh, first rule of Fight Club
is you do not talk about Fight Club.

366
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,715
Cute.

367
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,426
Second rule of Fight Club is
you do not talk about Fight Club.

368
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,929
- Am I paying you both for this?
- It's free.

369
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,266
- This is a new look.
- You like it?

370
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,435
It's very Hot Topic.

371
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,604
What?

372
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,234
- What the heck is Hot Topic?
- I don't know, but I think he insulted me.

373
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,611
Cynthia, would you like a refill?

374
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:43,325
- It's 4:00 p.m. somewhere, right?
- It's 4:00 p.m. here. 4:15, actually.

375
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,868
Oh, that's good.

376
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,246
If you're about to ask me
how I'm doing, don't.

377
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,331
I'm not doing well,
and I don't wanna talk about it...

378
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,251
Oh my God, what happened to your eye?

379
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,878
Well, if you're not talking,
I'm not either.

380
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,966
Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe.
I need help only you can provide.

381
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,385
- Goody.
- I need your caterer menu.

382
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,345
I'm throwing a party
at the Neighborhood Club.

383
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,430
You're looking at their newest member.

384
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,851
- Congratulations.
- Who punched you in the face?

385
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,526
What party did you throw
when you were a new member?

386
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,569
- Tom and I did a tailgating party.
- Oh.

387
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:23,782
We hired some high school football players
to wear their uniforms and pass out wings,

388
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,076
- and Tom tapped a keg.
- Mm.

389
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,621
Sounds really fun. Damn it.

390
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,541
Hey, Peach,
can you make me a gingerbread latte?

391
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,837
You're invited too, Joe.

392
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,339
You don't have to invite me
if you just want me to cater.

393
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,092
I'm inviting you
because I want you to come.

394
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,302
We're friends.

395
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,553
And I want you to cater.

396
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,641
Thank you.

397
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,825
Hello, Ellen.

398
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,744
I come waving a white flag.

399
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:12,039
- Well, white wine. Same thing.
- What do you want, Georgia?

400
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,583
I'm in the middle of making
the twins' birthday dinners, okay?

401
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:19,046
And Marcus wants burgers,
and Maxine wants chicken ziti, so…

402
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,341
I messed up. I should have told you
about Marcus and Ginny.

403
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,093
I don't have a good excuse.
I should have, and I'm sorry.

404
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,971
I usually handle everything myself, and…

405
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,808
I don't know how to explain it
other than that, but…

406
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,101
…I miss you.

407
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,978
I miss my friend.

408
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,815
Okay. I miss you too.

409
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,154
Here. You might wanna pour that.

410
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,448
I learned my lesson,
and I came over to tell you

411
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,784
that Marcus is climbing through
Ginny's window again.

412
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,993
I caught him last night.

413
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:53,038
Who does he think he is?
Christian Slater in <i>Heathers</i>?

414
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,582
Oh, that's a good one.
I didn't think of that one.

415
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,168
Unbelievable. Do they think we're stupid?

416
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,211
Yeah.

417
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,172
Why can't they just date
and use the front door?

418
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,926
Oh no, you are not snacking

419
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:08,178
after I made
two separate birthday dinners.

420
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:11,807
Mommy, there are no rules on birthdays.
Hi, Georgia.

421
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,350
Happy birthday, Max.

422
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,977
- Got fun birthday plans?
- None that Ginny's invited to.

423
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:20,273
Maxine, it is not nice to hold a grudge.
People make mistakes.

424
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,235
And if you push everyone away,
you will not have anyone left.

425
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,156
Marcus, I'm gonna kill you!

426
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,909
<i>♪ Think that I'll break?
Well, I can handle that… ♪</i>

427
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,539
Seriously? Ginny wasn't enough for you,
you had to take Abby too?

428
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,290
Why are you doing this to me
on my birthday?

429
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,668
Our birthday.
And I didn't do anything to you.

430

<i>♪ And just F me up, yeah, mess me up… ♪</i>

431

- Hey.

436
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,023
All right.

437
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,278
- Oh no, not that dr...
- Wow.

438
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,114
- Okay.
- What do we have here?

439
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,867
- Yeah, ha-ha.
- There's so many of them.

440
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,161
- Okay.
- They're like jelly beans or...

441
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,704
- I found their leader.
- Okay.

442
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,831
- Big Daddy.
- All right. Put it back now.

443
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,041
- How's this one even work?
- Come on. All right.

444
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,501
- Oh, Big Daddy.
- Paul. Paul, stop.

445
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,587
- Oh, he's got a mind of his own.
- Put it back.

446
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,255
- Be gentle, Big Daddy.
- Very good.

447
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,466
Be gentle, Big Daddy.
Where does this even go?

448
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,176
Hey, Mom, I can't find my…

449
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:34,264
I need to knock. I know that now.

450
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:41,188
I'm just really gunning for
that Mother of the Year award, huh?

451
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,064
What do you think?

452
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,858
Should I be worried
I screwed her up so bad

453
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,444
she's about to freebase heroin
and join the circus?

454
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,196
What?

455
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,073
Nothing. I just... I...

456
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,953
You know what? Can I ask you something
without you getting mad?

457
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,914
Mm. No promises.

458
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:00,832
Austin.

459
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,460
Could you help me understand

460
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,379
why you wouldn't do
what his teacher recommend...

461
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,173
I'm mad.

462
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,257
I'm serious.

463
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:14,721
Look, I… I watched my parents
go through very similar things with Chris.

464
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,724
- Austin and Chris aren't the same.
- I know they're not.

465
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,309
I'm not saying they are.

466
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:23,855
But, you know, Austin might also benefit
from a little bit of extra attention,

467
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,273
and there are resources available.

468
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,151
I'm not slapping a label on him
that'll follow him around his whole life.

469
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,653
That changes how the world sees him.

470
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,530
He's fine,
and I don't wanna talk about this.

471
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,740
Why deny him the help?
You don't have to do this yourself.

472
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,450
They're not your kids!

473
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,911
Wow.

474
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:40,080
- Um…
- Hey, that came out too harsh.

475
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,292
I just mean that I've got it.
Okay? That's all.

476
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,752
- Okay? I...
- No. You know what?

477
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,297
No. I… I hear you loud and clear.
Okay? Boundary is very well set.

478
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,967
I will not be told
about Ginny's new boyfriend.

479
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,762
I will not be trusted
to try and help with Austin.

480
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,265
Oh, like how you trust me at work?

481
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,849
What is that supposed to mean?

482
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:03,937
Well, I've proven myself again and again,
and I'm still not being looped in.

483
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,856
It's like we got engaged
and I'm getting cut out. What is that?

484
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,693
Okay, is this about Nick? Because
I understand that he's been a little...

485
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,654
No, I know how Nick's been.
I don't care. You're the boss.

486
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,200
And you put Big Daddy
back where you found him.

487
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,586
Hey.

488
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,963
Sorry about that.

489
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,381
Good for you.

490
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:34,342
Good for Paul, really. Surprising.

491
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,679
Hey, Peach, there is something
I wanted to talk to you about.

492
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,473
- God.
- No, nothing bad.

493
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,641
Um…

494
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,060
I'm getting married,

495
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,688
and you're my best friend.

496
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,734
Will you be my maid of honor?

497
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,780
Mom, yes, of course.

498
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,824
- Yeah?
- Yes.

499
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,701
Aw!

500
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,460
I just don't wanna
have messed you up too bad.

501
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,003
Have I messed you up?

502
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,213
No, I'm okay.

503
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,633
Okay.

504
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,052
All right.

505
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,262

- Yay!

00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,440
Thanks.

536
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,568
Yeah, I've always wanted to dye my hair.

Do you remember when we were 11

538
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,869
and we stole beer from your dad
and poured it on our heads

539
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,497
to lie out in the sun
to try and get highlights?

540
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,624
We were so embarrassing.

541
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:38,127
- We should've just drank the beer.
- We should've just... So true.

- She's being absurd.

547
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,519
It's kind of funny.

548
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,735
- Things have been a lot better.
- Let's talk more about your mother.

549
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:07,699
Can we not refer to her as my "mother"?
It's very Kathy Bates.

550
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,909
What's your relationship like?

551
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:16,666
Well, uh, she's not really like
a normal mom.

552
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,460
She was just smoking weed
with my boyfriend.

553
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,006
I guess he's not officially my boyfriend.

554
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,551
How do you feel about her doing that?

555
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,137
She just does stuff like that.

556
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,975
Is this stressful for you?

557
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,188
No. I mean, that's just what she's like.

558
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,276
Can I ask you a question?

559
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,028
Of course.

560
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,323
How much of who you are

561
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,617
and what you're capable of
is predetermined?

562
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,078
Like… Like, by genetics or whatever?

563
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,623
Why are you asking me that?

564
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,002
It was just a dumb thought. It's nothing.

565
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,839
This is the moment
you identify what you're feeling

566
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,133
and what makes you want to self-harm.

567
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,261
You have to be honest
about how you're really feeling,

568
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,721
or it won't get better.

569
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,514
Yeah.

570
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,141
Yeah, I know.

571
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,770
Like I said, I'm... I'm fine.

572
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,653
I like the blue. It's a nice touch.

573
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,488
Thanks.

574
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:32,200
So your mom asked me
to take you and Austin for Friday night.

575
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,286
Oh, um, actually just Austin.

576
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,246
I'll be spending the night
at a friend's house.

577
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,457
Mm.

578
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,336
Simone?

579
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,839
It's no one. Um, how's school?

580
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,008
Max hates me.

581
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,594
You'd be surprised how little
people actually think about you.

582
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,429
Okay, normally I'd agree with you,

583
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,057
but I can assure you Max hates me,
and she thinks about it a lot.

584
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,142
Have you tried speaking to her?

585
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,062
Okay, you don't like that idea. Um…

586
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,855
How's Bracia?

587
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,109
The guy she likes
commented "fire" on the picture you took,

588
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,111
so you basically made her entire life.

589
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,366
And how's therapy?

590
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,452
I'm not burning
if that's what you're asking.

591
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,954
That's not what I asked.

592
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:20,873
Therapy's working.

593
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,750
I'm much better.

594
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,091
So tell me about this "no one" Simone.

595
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,807
Anthony Green…

596
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,726
Do you…

597
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,519
…remember any details?

598
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:45,481
Do I remember a missing person's case
from over a decade ago?

599
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,735
It's New Orleans. Do you know
how many of these we deal with?

600
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,237
Yeah.

601
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,701
- What?
- His wife.

602
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,124
I do remember her. I felt bad for her.

603
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,333
Pretty young gal.

604
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,086
Looks like your memory's been jogged.

605
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,506
He ran an illegal gambling ring,
which she took the fall for.

606
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,841
She got booked,

607
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,635
and as soon as she got out, he bolted.

608
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,055
Shameful.

609
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:20,975
So she was never a person of interest
in his disappearance?

610
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,188
How's she gonna take a man down
and move a body? Look at her.

611
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,483
Uh, must be very convenient for her.

612
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,109
What?

613
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,612
Everyone underestimates her.

614
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,866
Hey.

615
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,744
- Hey, how was your dad's?
- It was good.

616
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,332
- Oh no.
- What?

00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,876

00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,864

Ginny! Didn't see you
come through the front door.

658
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,619
This is cozy.

659
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,955
Just gonna slide in here.

660
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,917
Okay, what are we talking about?

661
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,589
My mom told you, didn't she?

662
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,218
Let's just hang out here all night.

663
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,727
Looks like they made up, huh?

664
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,231
Okay, I don't get it.
I'm not the one who did anything wrong.

665
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,691
Yeah, babe, I don't know.

666
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,652
I got bad news, <i>mi amors</i>.

667
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,029
My basement flooded.

668
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:23,908
- Okay, that better be a euphemism.
- Sorry, no party tonight.

669
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,743
Okay, this cannot be happening to me.

670
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,620
Well, look on the bright side.

671
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:30,623
Now it doesn't matter
that you lost all your friends.

672
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:31,791
Oof.

673
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,877
- I'm kidding.
- Love you, Max.

674
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,215
- Hey, Ginny.
- Bye, Ginny.

675
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:44,720
- No, no! Excuse me. No.
- What do you want now?

676
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,639
I'm the one who's mad, not you.

677
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:50,476
Oh, I'm sorry, Max. Did I disrupt
the equilibrium of the universe

678
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,687
by suggesting that something
not be centered around you?

679
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,983
Okay, ouch. And also, bitch.
You're the one in the wrong here.

680
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,818
Oh, you love that, don't you?

681
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,695
You love that I screwed up
and you're perfect.

682
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,030
I'm not perfect,
but I didn't sleep with your brother.

683
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,866
- Good, because that'd be a felony.
- You lied to me, Ginny!

684
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,660
So freaking what?

685
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,997
I'm supposed to tell you everything?
That's not what friendship is.

686
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,124
Friendship is not having to reveal

687
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,876
every innermost thought and secret
to each other.

688
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,421
To me, friendship is
about supporting each other.

689
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:19,797
It seems to me that a friend

690
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,049
wouldn't write off someone
without having the full story.

691
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,134
The full story?

692
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,594
Do I need a play-by-play
of how you boned my brother?

693
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,388
'Cause I'm pretty sure
I know how that went.

694
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:32,059
"Oh, Ginny, I'm dark
and gloomy and colors hurt my eyes."

695
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,146
"Oh, Marcus,
I'm finding myself."

696
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,942
"Will you point the way with your penis?"

697
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,944
You talk a lot, but it's not all quality.

698
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,530
Ooh, look who dyed her hair
and grew a backbone.

699
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,782
Are you gonna apologize or what?

700
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,993
- That's a joke.
- It's not, Max.

701
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,286
Because I love you.

702
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,372
Okay? I love you so much,
and you've hurt me.

703
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,707
God. Sometimes I just...

704
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,959
I feel like what I'm going through
and who I am

705
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,919
is just completely invisible to you.

706
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,465
I tried to not love your brother,
I really did.

707
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:06,635
But, I don't know, you Bakers have some
pheromone-y DNA or something.

708
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,970
- You love him?
- Yes.

709
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:11,265
Like real, real love? Like his greasy hair
doesn't bug you at all?

710
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,183
Yes.

711
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,227
I didn't know that.

712
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,063
I get him, and he gets me.

713
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,858
And we really tried to stop it,
because I love you too.

714
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,156
So you'd be like my sister-in-law.

715
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,075
Okay, well, that's…
that's aggressive, but…

716
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,619
I'm really sorry I've been so mean.

717
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,955
I've just been hurting so much,
it's leaking out of me like a faucet.

718
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,708
And I've been such a bitch,
a huge bitchity bitch.

719
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,378
And it's probably good
that Brodie's basement flooded

720
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,089
because I don't really have friends
to bring to my party.

721
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,715
I just want us to be okay.

722
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,134
Me too.

723
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,261
I really miss you.

724
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,939
What's this, the band's back together?

725
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,318
No.

726
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,237
No, Ginny, no.

727
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,824
- Yes. Yes, Ginny, yes.
- You don't know what we're talking about.

728
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,159
I don't, but I know I want it to happen.

729
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:13,828
Fine.

730
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,164
For your birthday,
you can have my birthday.

731
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,499
Yay!

732
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,292
What does that mean?

733
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,002
- Party at my house.
- What?

734
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:26,632
Okay.
I'm violently excited. Let's do it.

735
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,848
Thanks.

736
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,057
Mm-hmm.

737
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:52,074
- Georgia. Paul.
- Joe!

738
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,285
We're celebrating
Paul's last night of freedom.

739
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,162
He's officially moved in tomorrow.

740
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,538
End of an era.

741
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,458
Oh, of course. Congrats.

742
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,335
Um, let me get you
a bottle of wine on the house.

743
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,837
Oh, you don't have to...

744
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:07,882
Hmm.

745
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,177
I think Joe might have
a little crush on you.

746
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,262
Oh, stop. No, he doesn't.

747
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:14,847
Okay.

748
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,104
Hmm.

749
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,192
Yes!

750
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,695
Okay!

751
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,659
- You shouldn't be talking about me.
- Oh, all right…

752
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,871
He is so... Listen, you guys...

753
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,498
- Cheers.
- Yay.

754
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,707
Yay!

755
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,254
Mistakes were made… by me.

756
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,175
Feelings were hurt,
and I wish I could change things.

757
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,676
Regrets abound.

758
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,472
Is this an apology?

759
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,432
I'm sorry.

760
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:01,519
I'm a dick, and I love you.

761
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,107
Let's do coffee shop.

762
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,317
Bing, bing, bing...

763
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,028
- Caramel macchiato on the house.
- Here's your change.

764
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,617
I'm making a leaf 'cause I'm an artiste.
Here you go, it's hot.

765
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,576
So much!

766
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,370
You guys are weird.

767
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:23,958
My little love-stricken cherub,
angel, princess, demon.

768
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,961
- Marcus, huh? You have terrible taste.
- Thank you.

769
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:31,215
Yo, this has little gold flecks in it
that actually rip holes in your throat

770
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,467
so the alcohol enters
your bloodstream faster.

771
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,385
Perfect!

772
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,594
- You want?
- Yes.

773
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,762
To MANG!

774
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,681
To MANG!

775
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,937
Oh, you weren't… you weren't lying.

776
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:47,898
- Hi.
- Hey.

777
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,567
- That's discussing.
- Hey.

778
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,695
Come upstairs.

779
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:54,613
I'll get some drinks.

780
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,414

Yeah, I'm… I'm just so awkward though.

784
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,469
We just need a little more practice.

00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,180
- Here?
- Mm-hmm.

786
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,265

787
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,698

- Oh!

I asked her to come.

793
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,338

- Yeah.

794

Hey.

00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,589
Almost as lonely
as the person you wanna be with

943
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,383
not recognizing you anymore.

944
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,720
Tom didn't know my name today.

945
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,433
That's why I don't wanna go home.

946
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,243
Cheers.

947
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:54,212
If anything, <i>anything</i> would have happened,
your mother and I would've been liable.

948
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,547
Do you understand?

949
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,966
Yeah. I know, I'm sorry. It was dumb.

950
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,093
We expect more from you, Ginny.

951
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,306
- Georgia, do you have anything to add?
- Yeah.

952
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,266
Bad Ginny.

953
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:10,478
Okay.

954
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,150
Boy.

955
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,696
Hey, I'm sorry about the other night.

956
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,616
I love that you care about 'em.

957
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:26,244
I've just been the only one
looking after 'em for so long, I...

958
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:30,874
Listen, you are going to be a Randolph,
and they are going to be my kids too.

959
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,792
And I want that more than anything.

960
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,252
Okay.

961
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:41,468
Why are you so happy?

962
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,678
She threw a rager.

963
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,598
Like a<i> Can't Hardly Wait</i>,
<i>American Pie</i> rager.

964
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:49,309
Okay, and we're… happy about that?

965
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:53,939
Well, I didn't screw her up too bad.
She's a normal teenager. This is amazing.

966
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,650
Okay, if you say so.

967
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:57,901
Yeah.
