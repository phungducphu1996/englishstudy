1
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,640
Why are they making
four more Avatar movies?

2
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:08,805
It's not like the first one
was even that good.

3
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:11,095
What are you talking about?
You love that movie.

4
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,101
You even went as Avatar
for Halloween.

5
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:16,358
(CHUCKLES) I remember. That was
not a lot of clothes.

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:19,937
Hell, guys.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,021
-Hey.
-Hey.

8
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:24,028
I'm, I'm running a special today.

9
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:27,328
Buy something, keep having
a comic book store to come to.

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,448
Well, this is awkward.
I was actually gonna return this.

11
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,661
- What's wrong with it?
- I finished it.

12
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,548
Speaking of something
I find interesting,

13
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:42,467
did anyone read that article
about Bitcoin I sent you?

14
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,341
Yeah, I can't believe
a single Bitcoin

15
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,763
is worth about $5,000 now.

16
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,347
Wait, didn't we mine some
a few years ago?

17
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,261
Yeah, it was seven years ago.

18
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,726
Oh. Yeah, I remember that.

19
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,773
Really? All I can remember
from seven years ago

20
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,522
is I couldn't get Kesha's
"Tik Tok" out of my head.

21
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,479
<i>(SINGING) Tik Tok, on the clock</i>

22
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,190
Whoa, welcome home, Kesha.

23
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,197
No, we definitely mined some.

24
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,904
I remember sitting in your bedroom
and writing the program.

25
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,746
I think we ended up
with a bunch of it.

26
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,951
Wow, and at, like,
$5,000 apiece, that's...

27
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,503
Sounds like a lot of money,
which we agreed to share

28
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,004
'cause I was totally there.
I remember now.

29
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,762
- I can't believe we forgot about it.
- It's not that surprising.

30
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,589
They were basically worthless
when we got them.

31
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,807
I wish I knew how much we had.

32
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,513
Sheldon, you must remember.

33
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,053
Of course I do.

34
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,020
Oh, yeah, he and I totally remember.

35
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,524
You tell them, Sheldon.

36
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,979
I can't believe you haven't
seen Avatar yet.

37
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,314
What is wrong with you?

38
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:49,034
Penny and ljust started dating,
and you know I don't like big crowds.

39
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,199
Because you're afraid Penny will
leave you for someone in them?

40
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,325
Terrified.

41
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,081
Yes, instead of going out,

42
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,580
they just stay home
and have constant coitus.

43
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,755
Well, I didn't want to say it,
but I do like to hear it.

44
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,880
Yes, Ma, I'll be home for dinner.

45
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,884
No, I'm not ruining
my appetite with candy.

46
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,179
We're having brisket?

47
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,560
Be home at 6:00.

48
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,438
Hey, maybe we should double date.

49
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,265
I'll bring Penny
and you can bring your mom.

50
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,945
Make your jokes, but my date started
a savings account for me.

51
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,021
Did yours?

52
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,073
- Hey, you guys-
- Hey.

53
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,446
Stuart, good. I was wondering,

54
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,361
will you be accepting Bitcoin?

55
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,534
Well, I don't know what that is,
but it's got "coin" in it,

56
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:39,039
and my cash register doesn't,
so yeah.

57
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,712
Wait, what's Bitcoin?

58
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,337
It's a new online currency
that's been developed.

59
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,925
It's just like actual money,

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,970
except you can't see it, hold
it, or spend it on anything.

61
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,182
Sounds like the kind of money
I'm familiar with.

62
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,594
If it's not tangible,
how do you know

63
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,521
it's not just gonna
vanish tomorrow?

64
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,266
Really? You're dating Penny, and
you're gonna poke at something

65
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,771
that could vanish tomorrow?

66
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,686
I'll buy some Bitcoin.

67
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,272
ljust came into a little extra money

68
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,902
when my dad raised my allowance.

69
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,785
You don't have to buy Bitcoin.

70
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,032
You can mine it.

71
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,280
Mine it?
Like, mining gold?

72
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,366
Sort of. There's a limited amount,

73
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,827
and we find it,
not by tunneling into the earth,

74
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,210
but by using a computer to solve
complex mathematical problems.

75
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,331
So let me get this straight.

76
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,133
We have to write an elaborate program

77
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,054
in order to find a fake coin
that we can't spend on anything?

78
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,006
- Yes.
- That sounds fun.

79
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:35,924
Yeah, I'm in.

80
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,008
Staying up late,

81
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,186
writing code, it sounds like a party.

82
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,889
Hey, Stuart.
You want to mine some Bitcoin with us?

83
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,606
We'll write the program,
you bring the snacks?

84
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,184
Too rich for my blood.

85
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,687
All right, so just the four of us.

86
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,568
(GASPS) Before we begin,

87
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,821
this may have some
unprecedented tax implications.

88
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,573
In fact, we should start
early 'cause we are gonna be

89
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,871
on the phone with
the IRS for hours.

90
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,244
(GASPS) Did anybody else
just get goose bumps?

91
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,870
Great, so just the three of us.

92
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,164
Oh, yeah. We did it without you.

93
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,545
And do you remember
what happened next?

94
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,968
Your mom called my mom
and said we were being mean?

95
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,343
And after that?

96
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,426
You said that someday
we'd regret this.

97
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,179
And do you know what today is?

98
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,683
The day we found out we're rich
and none of it is yours?

104
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,440
So what are you gonna do
with your share of the money?

105
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:07,767
Ah, well, as a responsible adult,

106
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,398
I'll put that money into a CD,
wait for that CD to mature,

107
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,521
and then buy a tiger.

00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,867
We were, but Sheldon
didn't like any of them.

160
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,371
Some were too beachy,
some were too cliffy.

161
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,800
And all of them
were too outsidey.

162
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,886
Well, weddings aren't
about the location.

163
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,090
They're about standing up in
front of your family and friends

164
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:47,051
and promising that Sheldon
will never move back in here.

165
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,062
- Hi.
- PENNY: Hey.

166
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,305
What are you guys doing?

167
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,600
We have a bunch of Bitcoin
on an old laptop,

168
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,481
and it could be worth,
like, a lot of money.

169
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,560
What... You're kidding.

170
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,817
No. We could be sitting on a fortune.

171
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,194
Okay, let the record show,
I did not marry you for the money,

172
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,116
but you just got
way more attractive.

173
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,158
Damn it, it's not in here.

174
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,954
If only you had someone around
with an eidetic memory.

175
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,166
I bet they would know
what happened to it.

176
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,838
If you know, just tell us.

177
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,837
Well, excuse me, but if I recall
from seven years ago,

178
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,839
you don't want me
to be a part of this.

179
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,008
Sheldon, you can't still be mad.

180
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,130
Oh, please.

181
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,965
I have grudges that
go back to preschool.

182
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,137
Someday, I'm gonna find
a grown-up Elaine Dwyer

183
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,597
and eat her favorite crayon
while she watches.

184
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,935
Is that why there's an
Elaine Dwyer on our guest list?

185
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,821
Yes. That night,
I'm going to have the first dance

186
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,443
and the last laugh.

187
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,776
Sheldon, please.

188
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,120
Should I be the bigger man?

189
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,826
I think you should.

190
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,657
(CHUCKLING) Why'd <i>I</i> ask you?

191
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,250
Hey there, pretty lady.

192
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,297
I'm not waiting on your table for you.

193
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,426
Come on, this one is so annoying.

194
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,840
Excuse me, waitress.

195
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,798
You guys ready to order?

196
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,134
Can you take our picture, please?

197
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,684
Oh, sure.

198
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,227
Smile!

199
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,808
(CAMERA CLICKS)

200
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,274
Perfect.

201
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,980
Thank you. You may go now.

202
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,111
It was nice to meet you,

203
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,565
and I mean that politely,
not sincerely.

204
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,863
What was that?

205
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,036
I need to prove to my mother
that I'm on a date.

206
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,328
If she thinks
I faked the picture,

207
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,247
I might need you as a witness.
What's your name?

208
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,909
Bernadette.

209
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,794
- Hey, sweetie. Everybody good?
- Hey.

210
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,664
- Yeah.
- Fine.

211
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,961
You don't have to whisper,
you can just nod your head.

212
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,010
Or you could just speak.

213
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,682
- You having a good day?
- No, I missed an audition

214
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,684
because my computer broke,
and I didn't get the e-mail.

215
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,561
Would've been a perfect part for me.

216
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,358
Was it waitress
who ignores her customers?

217
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,401
Because that's the role
you were born to play.

218
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,113
Just shut up and eat your burger.

219
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,691
Actually, it's a turkey club.

220
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,991
Didn't you order a burger?

221
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,990
I did, and yet here we are.

222
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,491
You know what, if you need a computer,
you can use my laptop.

223
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,666
That's sweet, but I'm not
gonna take your computer.

224
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,289
It's fine.
I'm getting a new one anyway.

225
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,208
- Are you sure?
- Don't be silly.

226
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,709
He's desperate
to hold on to you.

227
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,416
You can get anything out of him.

228
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,213
His car, his watch...

229
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,215
Maybe a kidney.
You already have his testicles.

230
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,921
You can start a collection.

231
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,385
Oh, my God, that's right.
You gave me your laptop.

232
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,639
That was so sweet.

233
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,186
- So you know where it is?
- Of course.

234
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,434
- Great!
- All right!

235
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,015
I gave it to my ex-boyfriend Zack.

236
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,896
"No!

237
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,154
Okay, Zack, thank you so much.
We'll be right over.

238
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,027
He still has it.

239
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,446
I can't believe you took
a gift from me

240
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,997
and gave it to another man.

241
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,532
<i>SHELDON: Really?</i>

242
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,413
Of all the things she's given
to other men,

243
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,994
that's what you're
concerned about?

244
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,498
Please don't make
a big deal about this.

245
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,459
It was a long time ago,
we were broken up.

246
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:11,092
Which breakup was that? Was that
the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre?

247
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,381
No, no.

248
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,933
This might've been during
the Comic-Con Dump-A-Thon.

249
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,228
You have names for our breakups?

250
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,517
Well, they would really
blur together if we didn't.

251
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,855
The Comic-Con breakup's
easy to remember

252
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,106
because Leonard
was the saddest Pikachu.

253
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,986
Right, and he wiped his nose
on your cape,

254
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,362
and then you were
the saddest Darth Vader.

255
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,580
You know, Penny and I aren't
the only ones who've broken up.

256
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,123
So did Howard and Bernadette.

257
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,044
Not to brag, but all
my breakups have lasted.

258
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,882
I'm so sorry to hear
about you and Howard.

259
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,880
Thanks. ljust didn't think he was

260
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,712
the kind of guy who would be
doing weird stuff online.

261
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,848
Really? Wow, I thought
it was so obvious, but okay.

262
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,015
Look, I know it's hard,
but I think the best thing

263
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,016
to do after a breakup
is to take some time

264
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,221
and be by yourself.

265
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,224
Yeah, that's healthy.

266
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,732
Hey, babe, ready to go?

267
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,361
Do as I say, not as I do.

268
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,200
I cannot believe you're mad.

269
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,572
What... I'm not mad.

270
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,871
Oh. Really? Tell that to your eyebrows.

271
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,624
Bet I could place
a quarter between them,

272
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,042
and it would just stay there.

273
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,579
Fine, I'm mad.

274
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,007
I guess I was more upset
by our breakup than you.

275
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,209
That is not true.
Of course I was upset.

276
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:32,718
Didn't seem like it.

277
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,011
You started dating the first

278
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,135
tall, handsome hunk
you could find.

279
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,639
I'm sorry, are you mad
that I dated Zack or that you didn't?

280
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,235
- Hi.
- Hey, Zack.

281
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,146
So good to see you guys.

282
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,277
Man, we should
do this more often.

283
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,902
Come over to get laptops
back from you?

284
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,237
Totally.

285
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:00,863
So do you have it?

286
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,824
Of course I do.
Penny gave it to me as a gift.

287
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,542
You don't get rid
of something like that.

288
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,580
Huh.

289
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,043
All right, I'm sorry
I gave away your stupid laptop.

290
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,345
You should be. We were broken
up for, like, five minutes.

291
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,462
Are you guys fighting?

292
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,547
- Yeah.
- No.

293
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,507
Are you fighting about
whether or not you're fighting?

294
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,058
'Cause I've had that fight before.

295
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,136
Turns out we were, and I lost.

296
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,564
Leonard thinks when we broke up,
it didn't bother me.

297
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,640
That's crazy.

298
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,227
When we were going out, she used
to talk about you all the time.

299
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,187
In fact, I think
she only dated me

300
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,817
because I reminded her of you.

301
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,193
Sure.

302
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,822
Because we're both

303
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,748
people?

304
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,035
Damn right we are.

305
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,297
Oh, also, there was that video
about how much she missed you.

306
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,962
- What video?
- The one on the laptop.

307
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,549
I didn't mean to invade your
privacy, but I am a huge snoop.

308
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,797
Ask my neighbor. She'll tell you.

309
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,508
But not right now, she's in the shower.

(SIGHS) Hello, Leonard.

312

I was gonna write you an e-mail,
but I'm a little drunk,

316
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,252
A 'splanation.

317
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,832
-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
- SHELDON: Penny. Penny.

318
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:34,999
<i>Penny.</i>

319
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,302
Sheldon, go away.
I'm making a video.

320
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,838
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll come back when you're alone.

321
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,890
No, no, no. I am alone.

322
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,388
I'm just telling Leonard
why I broke up with him.

323
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,182
Oh, he knows.

324
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,478
The video I want to see

325
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,352
is why you went out with him
in the first place.

326
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,523
I went out with him
because he's great.

327
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,446
And if I kept going out with him,
I probably would've married him,

328
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,274
and that's a little scary

329
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,075
because ljust don't think
I'm ready for that.

330
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:05,034
You know, plus I have got to
learn how to spell Hofstadter.

331
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,783
I know there's a "D" in there,

332
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,835
but it keeps moving
every time I try and write it.

333
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,547
Sheldon, what do I do?

334
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,210
Try to pass out face down,
so you don't choke on your vomit.

335
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,547
<i>I am not gonna pass out.</i>

336
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,058
But thank you anyway.

337
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,516
- Wow.
- I know.

338
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,105
There's, like, two more hours
of her just lying there.

339
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,449
Aw, you love me so much.

340
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,609
- I married you, jackass.
- Yeah.

341
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,821
<i>I...</i> I know, and not just out of pity

342
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,164
like everyone said at our wedding toast.

343
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,288
You want to see the part
where she falls off the chair?

344
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,085
- No.
- Totally.

345
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,294
(THUDS)

346
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,217
- That's my wife.
-(CHUCKLES)

347
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,344
I got to see that again.

348
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,064
- Got the laptop.
- Hand it here.

349
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,436
Yep.

350
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,772
This is so exciting!

351
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,320
Hey, when we sell the Bitcoin,
are you gonna pay your dad back

352
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,942
all the money you took from him
over the years?

353
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,366
Never even crossed my mind.

354
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,618
Okay, here's the Bitcoin folder.

355
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,412
Yeah, how much is in there?

356
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,832
It's empty.

357
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,330
What? That's impossible.

358
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,204
Do you think Zack stole it?

359
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,164
He doesn't know how to steal Bitcoin.

360
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,090
I mean, he waves at trucks.

361
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,836
Hmm.

362
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,014
Who could it have been?

363
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,263
Sheldon, what did you do?

364
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,928
I plotted my revenge.

365
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,889
If you get a dish,
I'll serve you some cold.

366
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,855
What, you stole our Bitcoin?

367
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,859
Oh, calm down.
All I did was sneak onto your computer

368
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,441
and download your Bitcoin
onto a flash drive.

369
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,863
- What?
- But I'm not keeping it.

370
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,786
I just wanted
to watch you sweat.

371
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,204
If you want to watch him sweat,

372
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,373
walk up a flight
of stairs with him.

373
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:18,379
I've waited seven long years,
but it finally happened.

374
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,539
Where's our money?

375
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,000
That's the best part.

376
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,587
It's on the Batman flash drive
on your key chain.

377
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,713
You've had it
in your pocket all along.

378
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:28,798
(GASPS)

379
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,844
Sheldon,

380
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,892
I lost that key chain years ago.

381
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,857
Really?

382
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,070
(STAMMERS) Did you look under things?

383
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,704
Well, that is unfortunate.

384
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,532
I guess we've all learned
a lesson today.

385
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,166
- What was the lesson?
- I don't know.

386
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,258
<i>STUART: Huh. What's that?</i>

387
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,392
<i>Ooh. Batman flash drive.</i>

388
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,644
<i>It's pretty cool.</i>

389
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,435
<i>Huh, if I erase this,</i>

390
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,692
<i>I could probably resell it
for, like, 10 bucks.</i>

391
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,866
<i>Things are finally going my way.</i>

392
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,741
