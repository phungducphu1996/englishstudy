No, that's so unreasonable.

Yeah, well,
if you're going to be like this

4

right now either.

No, my mother.

we invite to our wedding.

Wait a minute. You didn't invite
your brother to your own wedding?

12
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:33,868
He tormented me my whole childhood.

13
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,290
I don't think
I should reward that type of behavior

A slice of wedding cake
in the shape of a cake.

Look, he may have been mean to you
when you were kids,

I'm a grown-up and if I don't wanna
invite him to my wedding then I won't.

00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,395
- Okay.
- Except I have to,

didn't invite his brother.

Um. Now it's starting
to sound like a wedding.

how do you know if someone has pink eye?

00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,801
Um, their eye would be red, swollen,

Okay, thanks.

So, am I gonna be, like, the only
single guy at Sheldon's wedding?

No, there will be
a lot of single people there.

00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:04,034
or maybe, like, anything else. ljust...

160
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,953
Oh! I don't wanna look like that
in your wedding photos.

161
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,911
There aren't gonna be
any wedding photos.

162
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,459
My fiancé's a germophobe.

163
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,629
If he finds out I'm contagious,
he'll never come back from Texas.

164
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,091
<i>What if we tell him
the theme of the wedding is Waking Dead</i>

165
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,587
<i>and this is our zombie makeup?</i>

166
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,212
That'll probably work.
We'll call that plan B.

167
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,258
Well, hmmm...

168
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,016
Turns out this is gonna
come in handy after all.

169
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,350
Hold up. I'm... I'm confused.

170
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,936
You didn't want me at your wedding.

171
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,859
But now that Mom won't come,
you want me there?

172
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:47,073
I know you don't hear this a lot,
but that is exactly right. Good job.

173
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,572
Not helping, Sheldon.

174
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,328
Listen here.

175
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,085
You want me at your wedding,
all you got to do is ask nicely.

176
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,917
(BREATH ES AND EXHALES HEAVILY)

177
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,461
- Georgie--
- George.

178
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,837
(GRUNTS)

179
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,263
I would like you at my wedding.

180
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,966
Thank you, Sheldon.

181
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,683
That is so nice to hear.

182
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,642
But I would rather swallow
a pregnant wildcat

183
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,894
and crap out a litter of kittens!

184
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,822
It is fitting that you got into tires,
because you are tiresome.

185
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:26,983
Sheldon, come on.

186
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,949
- Was that too mean?
- No, not too mean.

187
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,201
Not too good either.

188
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,292
No, Mother, that's not fair.

189
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:41,919
But he told...

190
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,671
Yes, ma'am.

191
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:45,673
But I said...

192
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,341
Yes, ma'am.

193
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,631
Goodbye.

194
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:51,758
What'd she say?

195
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,768
She's not getting in the middle of it,

196
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,642
because we "boys need to
work it out ourselves."

197
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,853
Well, maybe it's fine
if she doesn't come to the wedding.

198
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,609
I've got Amy now,

199
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,107
and she can do everything
a mom can do and more.

200
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,695
Say that to her on the wedding night,
really spice things up.

201
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,948
This is all Georgie's fault.

202
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,451
My whole childhood he was mean to me.

203
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,330
Sorry. I know what it's like
to live with a bully.

204
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,665
Your brother bullied you?

205
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,712
I was talking about Penny, but sure.

206
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,507
Once, when I was eight,

207
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,085
I was going to dress
as my favorite scientist for Halloween,

208
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,091
and Georgie threw my costume away.

209
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,385
I had to wear a sheet and go as a ghost.

210
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,225
Scared myself all night long.

211
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,729
Look, we don't fly out
until the morning.

212
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,399
Why don't I try and talk to him?
Give it one more shot?

213
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,227
All right.

214
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,156
But if he says, "Nerd says what,"
don't answer him.

215
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,199
- What?
- You are a lamb to the slaughter.

216
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,704
So, how was your date?

217
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,212
It was going well
until my eye dripped in her latte.

218
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,796
We're so sorry we ruined your date.

219
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,835
Oh! Boo-hoo!

220
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,425
I mean, his date got ruined.

221
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,132
I'm about to get married and look at me.

222
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,010
Looks like it's getting better.

223
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:21,189
Oh! Does it? Does it look like that
with your two clear eyes?

224
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,610
I'm sorry, are you mad
that I don't have pink eye?

225
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,982
- What do you think?
- ALL: Yes!

226
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,241
Uh-huh. Okay. Okay.
Listen, I hear you.

227
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,905
I know they're pricey,

228
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:40,834
but these are the Dallas Cowboys
of tires, okay?

229
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,668
And we're talking
the Troy Aikman Cowboys,

230
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,496
<i>not that pretty boy, Tony Rome.</i>

231
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,043
All right, good call.
You won't regret it.

232
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,048
- Boom!
-(LAUGHS)

233
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,629
Wow! That was impressive.

234
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,090
Yeah, well, it's easy
when you love your product,

235
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:56,887
<i>and hate Tony Rome.</i>

236
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,307
Yeah, that guy's...

237
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,889
I'm sorry, I don't know who that guy is.

238
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,102
If you're here about Sheldon's wedding,
don't bother.

239
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,026
Come on, I know
you two have your differences.

240
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,777
You mean pretty much
everything about us?

241
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,612
Well, not everything.

242
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,988
You're both tall,

243
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,869
you have the same last name...

244
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,240
Maybe I shouldn't have started this
like it was a list.

245
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,036
You have no idea
what you are talking about.

246
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,496
Ooh! There, that was very Sheldon.

247
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,173
Look, I'm... I'm sure
he was not the easiest brother to have,

248
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,677
but it wasn't easy for him either
with you picking on him all the time.

249
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,556
(LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY)

250
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,306
Picking on him?
ls that what he told you?

251
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,938
Well, what about the time
you threw away his Halloween costume?

252
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,814
Well, yeah, 'cause he was gonna dress
as some girl scientist.

253
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,729
Madame Curie?

254
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,899
I didn't know she was a madam.

255
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,159
Come on, he was still gonna get beat up
for wearing that dress.

256
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,454
Didn't you sit on his head
while he tried to watch Star Trek?

257
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,748
Well, yeah, but that was hilarious.

258
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,331
That is pretty hilarious.

259
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,965
Look, I mean, uh...

260
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,635
I always looked out for him at school,
I drove him everywhere,

261
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,089
I apologized to people when he was rude.

262
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,265
Yeah. I've done all that.

263
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,761
I've also removed all the red balloons
from his Lucky Charms,

264
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,471
because they weren't "lrish enough."

265
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,769
All right,
so you know what I'm talking about.

266
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,566
And has he ever thanked you?

267
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,269
Not in so many words...

268
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,941
Or any words.

269
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,858
Would it kill him to actually say it?

270
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:38,443
No.

271
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,612
No, it wouldn't kill him.

272
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,282
Leonard...

273
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,333
You know how I got the money
to open up my first store?

274
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,006
I busted my ass for it,

275
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,963
'cause all the extra money that we had
had to go to Sheldon,

276
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,263
so he could go to college,
and he could go study in Germany.

277
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,265
And do you know
what he's never said to me?

278
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,388
<i>Danke schfan?</i>

279
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,976
It's "thank you" in German.

280
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,149
Do you need me to sit on your head?

281
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,148
Nope.

282
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,941
After all my sacrifices,

283
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,442
guess which kid
my mom is the most proud of.

284
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,407
If it makes you feel any better,

285
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,660
my mom's most proud
of Sheldon too, so...

286
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:27,909
Leonard,

287
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,790
you want a beer?

288
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,580
Yeah, I would love a beer.

289
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,332
- There you go.
- Thanks. Can you open it for me?

290
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,917
- No. It's a twist-off.
- I know.

291
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,898
Hey, I got all the beads
to the other side.

292
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,277
It's not a puzzle, Penny.

293
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,110
Do you really wanna be touching that?

294
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,782
Do you know how many sick kids--

295
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,859
You know what?
Never mind, knock yourself out.

296
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,404
(PHONE CHIMES)

297
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,535
Bernadette says
they're checking the kids now.

298
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,787
You know,
maybe we didn't all need to come.

299
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,378
Hey, whatever kind of pink eye
their kids have, I have.

300
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,423
And I need to know.
And if it's viral, I'm screwed.

301
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,624
Maybe not.

302
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,176
You know, I know
it's not traditional wedding attire,

303
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,004
but how about a welder's mask?

304
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,182
If you know a welder
that could be your something borrowed.

305
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,846
Great news, it's bacterial.

306
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,432
- Yeah!
- Yes!

307
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,189
- What are you doing? Wash your hands!
- Not you.

308
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,865
Hello, room service.

309
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,739
I'm calling about the club sandwich
on your menu.

310
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:48,490
No, I don't want one.
ljust want you to spell it correctly.

311
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,207
Unless the "club"
is the Poor Typing Club.

312
00:15:54,412 --> 00:16:00,215
Okay. Now let's discuss
this "15% gratooty."

313
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,846
Well, that was rude.

314
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,674
Someone just lost their gratooty.

315

316
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,976
Sheldon, you need to apologize
to your brother.

317
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,689
Rm sorry?

318
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,892
Yes, like that but nicer and that way.

319
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,362
- I have nothing to apologize for.
- Huh.

320
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,982
I told you this was a bad idea.

321
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,943
Sometimes you can't patch a tire,
you just got to buy a new one.

322
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,121
Actually, that's always the case.
Never patch, buy new.

323
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,579
While I appreciate
your folksy tire wisdom,

324
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,207
I don't appreciate
what you're putting Mom through.

325
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,087
What would you know about
what Mom's been through?

326
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,255
You were never home.

327
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,004
Yeah. This is good, get it all out.

328
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,083
- Not now.
- Shut up!

329
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,924
You went away to college after Dad died.

330
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,755
Who do you think
took care of everything?

331
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,974
Mom did.
Mom always took care of everything.

332
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,597
Mom was a mess.

333
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,268
Missy was a dumb teenager.
I had to look after both of them.

334
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,103
I talked to Mom all the time.

335
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,934
If she was upset,
she would have told me.

336
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:02,147
She was protecting you, you idiot,
just like everyone always does.

337
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,407
If things were bad,
then why didn't you tell me?

338
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,656
Because I was protecting you too.

339
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,828
You're my baby brother, Sheldon.

340
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,664
I know life has been hard for you,

341
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,126
but that don't mean
it's been easy for the rest of us.

342
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,257
I suppose I didn't think about
how it was for everyone else.

343
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,095
No, that's all right.

344
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,677
I know you didn't.
(SCOFFS)

345
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,843
I'm sorry.

346
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,472
Thank you.

347
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:42,066
And it would mean a lot to me
to have my big brother at my wedding.

348
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,609
I wouldn't miss it.

349
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,329
Is it me or did we just patch a tire?

350
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,379
He said "never patch."
Do you even listen?

351
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,841
(COMPUTER RINGING)

352
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,306
<i>Hell, how's it going?</i>

353
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:18,977
Really good.

354
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,434
Georgie's going to come to the wedding.

355
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,985
<i>Oh! That's great!</i>

356
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,317
Why aren't you looking at the camera?

357
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,615
<i>You know, I'm just working
on my peripheral vision.</i>

358
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,740
That is nonsense.

359
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,038
Your peripheral vision is fine.

360
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,833
Are those women's magazines making you
feel bad about yourself again?

361
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,746
Yep, that is what's happening.

362
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:44,628
I have told you before.

363
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,709
Those women are airbrushed,

364
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,760
to make it look like
they have good vision.

365
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,221
Hey, I was thinking,
now that you and your brother made up,

366
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,094
there's no reason to rush home.

367
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,812
<i>Maybe you and Leonard could...</i>

368
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,059
Could stay for...

369
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,734
Two to three more
fun-filled days there.

370
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,655
That's a great idea.

371
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,448
Hey, Leonard, good news.

372
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,777
We do have time to visit
the Museum of the American Railroad.

373
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,622
I'd say no, but what's the point?

374
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,922
You might not wanna get too close.

375
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:26,670
Pink eye.

376
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,509
Me, too!

377
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,797
- Bacterial?
- Yeah.

378
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,177
Same!

379
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,893
I know this is gonna sound crazy,

380
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,555
but would you be interested
in going to a wedding with me?

381
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,229
