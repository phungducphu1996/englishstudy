1
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:06,215
One dumpling left. Who wants it?

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,759
Maybe you should offer it
to the pregnant lady.

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:11,932
And that would be?

4
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,021
Me, Sheldon, I'm obviously pregnant.

5
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,061
Well, you never said it to my face,

6
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,448
and the last time I assumed a woman
was pregnant, it did not go over well.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,066
Yeah, I'm still mad at you.

8
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,536
You were drinking water instead of wine,

9
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:29,659
what was I supposed to think?

10
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,039
Sheldon's right. I would never ask
a woman if she was pregnant

11
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:38,338
unless she tells me, or I see
a human being wiggling out of her.

12
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,134
Well, Sheldon, I'm pregnant.

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,386
Congratulations! How far along are you?

14
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,712
About three months.

15
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,301
Only three?

16
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,055
Good gravy,
how many babies are in there?

17
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,857
Okay, let's talk about something
that won't infuriate my pregnant wife.

18
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,485
I read an interesting fact
about elephants.

19
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,603
Try again.

20
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:07,155
Oh, I've got something. I'm being
interviewed on public radio this Friday.

21
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,610
Oh, cool. How come?

22
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,368
The university's trying to get
more funding for the physics department,

23
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,035
<i>so</i> they want me to go out
and talk it up.

24
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,582
Really, you?

25
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,247
Well, they picked the right person
for the job.

26
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:22,799
Thank you.

27
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,209
I think he bought it.

28
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,048
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

29
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,453
Hi, I'm Ira Flatow,
and this is Science Friday.

30
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:59,127
Joining me today is my guest physicist
Doctor Leonard Hofstadter,

31
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,836
to talk about all of the exciting
research they're doing at Caltech.

32
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,425
Thank you for having me. Whoa.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

33
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,674
I never get used to hearing
myself in headphones.

34
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:08,754
Is that really how I sound?

35
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,297
(CHUCKLES)

36
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,381
It is, it is.

37
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,179
(HEAVY VOICE) That is good to know.

38
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,513
I told him his voice was annoying,
he didn't wanna listen.

39
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:19,723
Hey!

40
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,190
What, you're saying it's not?

41
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,690
Just, hey.

42
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,402
So it has been five years
since the discovery of the Higgs boson.

43
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,617
What's the next big thing gonna be?

44
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,570
(LIGHT CHUCKLE) Wow, that's hard to say,
there's so much going on.

45
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,455
We've been collecting tons of data

46
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,953
that could revolutionize
the way we understand the universe.

47
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,870
Uh, for instance,
there's a particle called a squark,

48
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,750
which could prove supersymmetry!

49
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,460
That is interesting. Have you found it?

50
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:45,874
- What, the squark?
- Yes.

51
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,042
No, no.

52
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,629
Wouldn't that be exciting?
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

53
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,761
But we're also looking for
the selectron,

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,887
the gluino, and the neutralino.

55
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,430
- And have you found that?
- No.

56
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,896
But, uh, fun side note,

57
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,440
I went to high school
with a girl named Theresa Gluino.

58
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,232
But it didn't cost
two billion dollars to find her.

59
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,779
She was smoking behind the gym.
(CHUCKLES)

60
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,861
So, what have you found?

61
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,025
Um, nothing actually.

62
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,735
Should he be saying that?

63
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:15,487
Probably not.

64
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,573
Yeah, this is public radio.

65
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,167
Doesn't he realize
dozens of people might hear him?

66
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,121
But, I remain confident.

67
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,792
We've got the best equipment,
and the best minds all working on it.

68
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,881
Okay, sounds like he's back on track.

69
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,463
Although, some days I'm like,

70
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,511
"Ugh, we've spent so much money.

71
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:37,517
Why haven't we found anything?
What are we doing?"

72
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,432
Oh, boy.

73
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,230
There's Leonard. I bet he's having
a rough day. (CHUCKLES)

74
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,822
Let's just try to be supportive.

75
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,449
Supportive?

76

He publicly maligned
the love of my life, Lady Physics.

77

Might not want to mention that
to Lady Fiancée.

Yeah, we're scientists,
isn't that what we're supposed to do?

Oh, what would you know about the truth?

You thought Phantom Menace
was "not half bad."

I told you that in confidence!

Okay, calm down, everybody.
Just cool it.

maybe one of them'll start crying.

Ooh, someone's got a lot of
fancy new lab equipment.

98
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,855
I know. The university's been
throwing money at my study.

99

With any luck, there'll be
a brain disease with my name on it.

Fingers crossed.

101
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,987
Which is ironic,
because if you had Fowler's Palsy,

102
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,565
you wouldn't be able
to cross your fingers.

103

I'm surprised Sheldon's not up here
playing with all your new toys.

Actually, I haven't told him about it.

than physics,

hide your success from him?

my company retreat was in Boise.

That's such a relief.

00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,803
I mean, part of me was worried
I was being unfair to Sheldon.

Take that part of yourself
and hide it away.

But it was only one interview.

125
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,085
How much damage could it have caused?

126
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,554
Would you like for me
to read you the emails

127

from donors asking
why are they giving us money

128
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,634

129
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,386
I didn't say it was a dead end.

130
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,391
I just said that
I was worried it might be.

131
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,892
So, if I just said I was worried
you might not have a job next week,

132
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,101
how would you feel?

133

Light-headed
and glad you asked me to sit down.

134

Okay, just tell me what I can do.

135
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,371
I'm gonna need you to make a statement
saying that you misspoke,

136
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,577
and that you're confident
the physics community

137
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,999
is close to a major breakthrough.

138

You want me to lie?

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,373
Look, Doctor Hofstadter,
I'm counting on you.

I think that you are the
smartest physicist at this university.

- See? Lies. They're not that hard.

Can we please
just talk about anything else?

We could talk about my day.

Walked right into that one, didn't I?

I got some new equipment for my lab.

160
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,853
Well, congratulations.

161
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,819
I got some new equipment, too.

162
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,942
I got these markers.

163
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,778
They smell like fruit,

164
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,992
which I did not notice
when I bought them.

165
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,907
(GASPS LIGHTLY)
Don't really care for it.

166
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,034
(SIGHS)

167
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,992
Here, drink this.

168
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,043
It might help.

169
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,622
- What if it doesn't?
- No, that's why I brought the bottle.

170
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,295
No one would talk to me in the halls,
they just glared at me.

171
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,091
It's like high school all over again.

172
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,799
Oh, I would totally do high school
all over again.

173
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,353
But that doesn't help you.

174
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,143
I got called into
the administration office.

175
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,438
Ooh, look at my bad boy
getting called to the principal.

176
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,440
We don't technically have a principal,

177
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,617
there's a standing committee
that oversees the budget.

178
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,863
Ooh, look at my bad boy
answering questions nobody asked.

179
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,873
Oh, come on, look, you said
a few dumb things on the radio.

180
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,326
What is the worst that could happen?

181
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,752
I may get fired.

182
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,503
Okay, well, even if you did,
you could find another job.

183
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,418
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Yeah, who wouldn't
wanna hire the physicist

184
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,344
who publicly said physics is dead.

185
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,014
Well, I wouldn't put that
under special skills.

186
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,349
Look, I can fix it. I just need to
write a retraction I don't believe in.

187
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,556
Basically sell out to keep my job.

188
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,682
Great, I'll leave you to it.

189
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,405
Hmm.

190
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,201
Hmm.

LEONARD: Sheldon, <i>it's</i> me.

194
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,342
- What?
- Look, I know you're mad,

195
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,680
but I have to write a statement

196
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,599
that says the physics community
is close to a breakthrough.

197
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,761
And since you actually believe that,
I could really use your help.

198
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,518
- Sorry, I can't.
- Come on, don't be like that.

199
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:00,104
I can't, because I think you were right.

200
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,985
- What?
- Look, (SIGHS)

201
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,529
not all science pans out.

202
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:09,159
You know, we've been hoping
supersymmetry was true for decades,

203
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,949
and finally we built
the Large Hadron Collider,

204
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,406
which is supposed to prove it
by finding these new particles,

205
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,581
but it hasn't.

206
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,161
Maybe supersymmetry,
our last big idea, is simply wrong.

207
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,296
That sounds awful.

208
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,712
Now I get why everyone hates me.

209
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,711
On the bright side,

210
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,680
after working together for 15 years,

211
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,757
you finally get to hear me say
you were right.

212
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,262
Yeah, you did.

213
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,855
How's it feel?

214
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,775
Given I might be unemployed,
bittersweet.

215
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,532
Read it back to me.

216
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,651
Hang on.

Oh, oh! On the other hand,
contrary to predictions,

222
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,926
the Collider didn't create
a small black hole

223
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,889
that devoured the Earth
and life as we know it.

So, (STUTTERS) money well spent.

225

This is depressing.

226

Do you have any alcohol around here?

227
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,478
Oh, not surprisingly, when Penny
moved out, she took every last drop.

228

Oh, but I do have several bottles
of Romulan Ale

229

that I bought at Comic-Con.

230
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,576
Isn't that just vodka
with blue dye in it?

231
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,579
First physics, now Romulan Ale.

232
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,209
What else would you like to defecate on?

233
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,709
Hey, I thought you were
coming right back.

234
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,628
I was, but we're both depressed

235
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,417
and decided to drown our sorrows.

236
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,715
In mouthwash?

237
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,429
Man, that is so summer camp.

238
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,474
It's Romulan Ale from Star Trek.

239
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,847
It was briefly legalized
during the alliance

240
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,103
between the Romulan Empire

241
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,150
and the Federation at the time
of the Dominion War.

242
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,353
Aw, now I'm depressed.

243
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,450
The more I told him about my lab,
the pissier he got.

244
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:15,777
You know what he said to me?

245
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:19,323
He said, "I hope all your correlations
turn out to be specious."

246
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,167
He said that to your face?

247
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,494
What a dick.

248
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,041
You know, you're a successful woman,

249
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,843
you should be able to brag about
your accomplishments once in a while.

250
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,595
And so should you.

251
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,389
I mean, the guys are never shy
about bragging.

252
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,761
Tell me about it.

253
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,094
Howie texts me every time
his dog levels up in Warcraft.

254
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,058
Has he ever called you to tell you
he found three peanuts in one shell?

255
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,604
'Cause Sheldon has.

256
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,778
We should be able to do that, too.

257
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,231
I guess we can brag to each other.

258
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,987
That's a great idea.

259
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,860
Damn right it is. I came up with it.

260
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,579
(CHUCKLES)

261
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,032
That felt good! (CHUCKLES)

262
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,753
You know, there's so much money
in pharmaceuticals,

263
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,581
we don't even wash out our test tubes.

264
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,087
We just throw 'em out and get new ones.

265
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,180
I just got a brand-new,
state-of-the-art FMRI machine.

266
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,891
- Those things are so expensive.
- I know.

267
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,644
Sometimes I just lie down in there
and take a nap.

268
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,768
It's like a million dollar bunk bed.

269
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,394
At the office, I have two assistants.

270
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,105
I don't even know their names.
I just call 'em Thing One and Thing Two.

271
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,534
That's great. I don't have assistants.

272
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,243
I guess that's one of the benefits
of being in the private sector.

273
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,327
That and all the money I make.

274
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,210
Yeah, you've got that.

275
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,996
I've got my integrity,
hard to say which is better

276
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,205
without making you feel bad.

277
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,011
Okay, so you guys are upset

278
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,760
because the Collider thing
disproved your theories?

279
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,136
L-it's worse than that.

280
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,892
It hasn't found anything in years,

281
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,969
so we don't know if we're right,
we don't know if we're wrong,

282
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,350
we don't know where to go next.

283
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,850
All I know is it looks like
I tongue-kissed Avatar.

284
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:15,150
Come on, you guys are physicists, okay?

285
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,981
You're always gonna be physicists,

286
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,534
and sure, sometimes the physics is hard.

287
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,240
But isn't that what makes it boring?

288
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,241
- RAJESH: Hey.
- We're here. (SIGHS)

289
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,876
- HOWARD: What's <i>going</i> on?
- Okay. As far as I can see,

290
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,375
science is dead
'cause Leonard killed it.

291
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,965
And I don't know who the Romulans are,

292
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,257
but those guys know how to party.

293
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,294
So, what do you want us to do?

294
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,054
I don't know. You're scientists,
cheer them up!

295
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,470
Cheer them up?
Do you even know what a scientist is?

296
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,387
No, we don't need to be cheered up.

297
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,098
It just turns out that
physics is exactly like <i>Lost.</i>

298
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,767
Started out great, and turns out
just a big ol' waste of time.

299
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,317
Boo-hoo. You know what
you sound like? Babies.

300
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,448
Two whiny babies.

301
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,906
There's nothing worse than
being stuck with two whiny babies!

302
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,660
Oh.

303
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,341
Oh, my God. I'm gonna have two babies.

304
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,260
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
Babies are great.

305
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,556
You're lucky to have two babies.

306
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,019
I mean look at me, uh, I'm all alone.
I'm never gonna have babies

307
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,731
'cause you can't make a baby
watching Netflix with your dog.

308
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,646
Thanks for coming.

309
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,701
I may not make as much money as you,

310
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,494
but at least I know that
I'm actually doing something

311
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,072
that makes people's lives better.

312
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,078
Hey, my work makes
people's lives better,

313
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,911
especially if you have moderate
to severe eczema

314
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,416
and don't mind a few loose teeth.

315
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,338
You're right, we both do important work.

316
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,298
I'm trying to map the structures
of the brain,

317
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,551
and you're trying to convince people
that itchy hair is a real thing.

318
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,763
It is a real thing!

319
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,224
It happens to be a side effect
of our cholesterol drug.

320
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:17,648
I'm just saying that my research
may actually change the world forever.

321
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,483
I hope it does,

322
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,698
'cause I'm gonna see that world
from a yacht so big

323
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,445
you can land a helicopter on it.

324
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,041
Physics is all we're cut out for.

325
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,544
I mean, if we weren't physicists,
what would we be?

326
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,589
I don't know, popular? (CHUCKLES)

327
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,459
RAJESH: Mm-hmm.

328
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,795
It's fine, I don't need to be
a theoretical physicist.

329
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,343
There's lots of things
I could use this brain for.

330
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,767
I could be an accountant for the mob.

331
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,347
I could guess people's weight
at the fair.

332
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,692
Okay, this is getting silly.

333
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,185
Is it?

334
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,811
One-eighty.

335
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,280
Okay, that is enough!

336
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,194
Your lives are not wasted,

337
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,904
your careers are not at a dead end.

338
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,614
You just hit a rough patch.

339
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,746
Instead of feeling sorry for yourselves,
you need to get up and get inspired.

340
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,627
- How?
- I don't know!

341
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,417
You know, when I'm feeling down,
I go for a run.

342
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,382
Which is exactly why I'm not
180 pounds, genius!

343
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,044
I know where we need to go.

344
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,260
Um, are we running there?
Because watching drunk Sheldon run

345
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,682
would be the highlight of my life.

<i>(RAJESH CHUCKLES)</i>

347
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,060
We're going to see Richard Feynman.

348
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,805
Penny, Richard Feynman
is an iconic physicist--

349
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,983
I know who he is. Leonard dressed as him
for Halloween last year.

350
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,107
I had no idea Richard Feynman was dead.

351
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,821
Yeah, most people don't know

352
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,949
he's actually buried
right here in Altadena.

353
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,582
I'm sure they keep a lid on that
to avoid traffic jams.

354
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,412
Well, (CHUCKLES) here he is. (SNIFFLES)

355
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,622
Oh, wow, he's buried with his wife.

356
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,633
We get it, a lady loved you.
Quit bragging!

357
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,554
Feynman was so cool.

358
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,929
When I was a kid,
I'd put on some headphones

359
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,181
and crank up one of his lectures

360
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,475
and just jam out to knowledge.

361
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,933
This guy knew how to live.

362
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,568
Taught himself musical instruments,

363
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:26,106
studied Portuguese
just to give a speech in Brazil.

364
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,655
The only part of me
that's been to Brazil is my bikini line.

365
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,153
Okay.

366
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,123
He did so much,

367
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,285
and here we are stuck
and letting him down.

368
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,710
You know, Feynman used to say
he didn't do physics

369
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,790
for the glory or the awards,

370
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,800
but just for the fun of it.

371
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,670
He's right.

372
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,637
Physics is only dead
when we stop being excited about it.

373
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,930
Even beyond the grave,
he's imparting wisdom.

374
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,557
Um, I'm the one who remembered it.

375
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,068
Give me the bottle.
It might be a little corny,

376
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,862
but I say we pour one out

377
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:10,191
for all the science homies
who came before us.

378
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,655

Yes, I wanted to talk to you about
