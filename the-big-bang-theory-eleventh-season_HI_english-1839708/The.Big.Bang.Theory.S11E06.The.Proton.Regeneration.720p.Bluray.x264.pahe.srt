No, not yet. And it won't be easy.

She's not a scientist.

touched me as a child,

using household items?

76
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,897
It's true. All you'll need is a pencil,

77
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,524
some paper, dry ice, rubbing alcohol

78
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,945
and a spool of 50-micron-thick
cobalt-60 wire.

And remember,
don't put it in your mouth.

Or, instead of becoming a scientist,
you'll become wildly radioactive.

Professor Proton was the reason
they got into science.

Wow.

332
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,465
That was very persuasive.
