1
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,177
Hey, can you do me a favor?

2
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,850
Can we try to avoid talking to
our friends tonight

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,519
about our wedding plans?

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,016
I'll do you one better.

5
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,348
I'll avoid talking
to our friends entirely

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,354
and play on my phone.

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,277
It's just, I haven't picked
a maid of honor yet,

8
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,822
and I'm having trouble deciding
between Penny and Bernadette.

9
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:25,234
Ah. Understandable.
They are quite similar.

10
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:29,038
Both blonde former waitresses
who married beneath them.

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,661
Penny is my best friend,

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,538
but I was Bernadette's
maid of honor,

13
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,244
and I think
she kind of expects it.

14
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,125
So, if anyone brings
it up tonight,

15
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,298
just maybe you can help
me change the subject.

16
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:43,335
How about this?
I dominate the conversation so hard,

17
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,297
no one has a chance
to get a word in edgewise.

18
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,184
I don't know.
They might see that coming.

19
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,769
What if we have a code word?

20
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,806
Now you're speaking my catamaran.

21
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,105
That's my code word for "language."

22
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,396
Okay, fine, catamaran.
That's our code word.

23
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,948
No, that's my code word.
Get your own.

24
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,197
Okay. Pretzels.

25
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,246
You hear me say pretzels,
you change the subject.

26
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,955
Rhinos are my least favorite
animals at the zoo.

27
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,619
What?

28
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,580
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we started.

29
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,881
Hey, just hold the gate
still while I screw it in.

30
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,763
You know, I don't know how I feel
about all this baby-proofing.

31
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:30,216
If Halley can't teach herself
to walk down the stairs,

32
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,887
then maybe that's nature's way
of saying

33
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,516
the Wolowitz line ends here.

34
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,764
That's funny.
I always thought

35
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,269
Howard was nature's way of saying

36
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,225
the Wolowitz line ends here.

37
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:45,072
Me, too, but life does
find a way!

38
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,408
Hey, Halley can't reach
the liquor cabinet.

39
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,655
Why did you baby-proof it?

40
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,321
How did you know we did?

41
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,991
Fair point.

42
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,751
- Bernadette still going stir-crazy?
- A little.

43
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,873
Two months of bed rest,
it's been rough.

44
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,046
Really? That sounds great.
How do I get that?

45
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,428
You'd either have to break your
hip or let Howard knock you up.

46
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,637
Now, either way, you'll get
flowers the next morning.

47
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,932
She's actually been
keeping herself busy

48
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,230
doing wedding research for you.

49
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,725
Oh! She doesn't have to do that.

50
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,812
She wants to. After all,
you were her maid of honor.

51
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,075
Sheldon, tell your funny story
about pretzels.

52
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,070
Oh. Right. Yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,655
Did you know that we've been thinking

54
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,953
of having pretzels
at our wedding?

55
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,997
No, no. I'm sorry.

56
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,204
No, rhinos. We're having
rhinos at our wedding.

57
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,290
No! I got to go.

58
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,846
I'm gonna need some help.
Someone baby-proofed the front door.

59
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,217
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

60
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,124
Sheldon, what am I gonna do
about my maid of honor?

61
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,919
I mean, Bernadette gave me
all these bridal magazines.

62
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,466
She even folded down the pages
with the good dresses.

63
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,378
I get it.
You know, Leonard

64
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,884
once borrowed
my Edmund Scientific catalog

65
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,591
and dog-eared some pages.

66
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,426
Never got 'em straight again.

67
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,013
Well, that is exactly the same thing.

68
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,190
You really understand my dilemma.

69
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,985
Actually, I do.
My mother

70
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,438
is pushing for my brother, Georgie,
to be my best man,

71
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,148
and I hate to disappoint her again.

72
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,656
I already rejected her savior
and her Linkedln invitation.

73
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,992
How are we gonna make these decisions

74
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,073
without anybody getting upset?

75
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,290
Well, what if we take emotion
out of the process,

76
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,963
and base it on empirical metrics?

77
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,757
Then we aren't really
making the decision,

78
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,005
the data is.

79
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,345
So we can hurt our friends' feelings

80
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,718
without taking any responsibility?

81
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,351
Me likey.

82
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,272
But how do we apply
quantitative metrics

83
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,146
to something as subjective
as choosing a wedding party?

84
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,148
That decision only seems subjective.

85
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,444
In reality,

86
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,444
people in a wedding party
perform very specific functions,

87
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,491
and some will perform those
better than others.

88
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,865
If I may use a superhero analogy-

89
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,242
- You may not.
- Okay, I'll use real people.

90
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:44,247
Um, if a certain dog-like loyalty
is useful,

91
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:47,626
then it's Leonard.
If having a PEZ dispenser

92
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,958
filled with TUMS is
an advantage, Wolowitz, yeah.

93
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,547
If a best man
with fake testicles hanging

94
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,628
from his truck is important,

95
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,554
well, then, my brother's
back in the running.

96
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,679
Okay, I see your point.

97
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,182
So, we break down
each of the roles

98
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,638
into their component parts,

99
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,395
and then design
specialized tests for each.

100
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,569
Exactly. Boy, if I had known
getting married was going to

101
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,147
involve so much science,
I'd have proposed years ago.

102
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,159
So Leonard, tell everyone your news.

103
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,154
I'm starting a book.

104
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,997
That would be big news from Penny,

105
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,496
but you've read a book before.

106
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,296
He means he's writing a book.

107
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,165
I do. It's something I've been
thinking about for a long time.

108
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,543
Yeah. It's about a brilliant physicist

109
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,549
who solves crimes using science.

110
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,051
- Oh, Leonard-
- It's not about you.

111
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,435
He probably has to say that
for legal reasons.

112
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,679
HOWARD: Uh-oh.

113
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,933
They gave us plain rice
instead of fried rice.

114
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,359
Well, no fair!
I SoulCycled this morning.

115
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,653
I'm entitled to a pile of fat rice.

116
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,860
Well, I would say that this
constitutes a catering crisis.

117
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,280
I agree. Who's gonna
step up and handle it?

118
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,620
Doesn't matter. This is fine.

119
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,668
(INAUDIBLE)

120
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,633
Penny?

121
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,169
What?

122
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,589
You know what?
I'll take care of it.

123
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,567
Done.

124
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,572
You didn't make him
feel bad, did you?

125
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,494
Actually, he was laughing.

126
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,788
I'm really impressed
at how you handled that, Howard.

127
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,253
Please. I've been sending food
back my entire life.

128
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,705
One of my first
full sentences was,

129
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,256
"I had breast milk for breakfast."

130
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,003
Excuse me,
before we start eating,

131
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,804
I would like to make a toast.

132
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,881
- Nice.
- Nice.

133
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,511
If only I could think of one.

134
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,389
Someone else go.

135
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,189
Hey. Here's the sewing kit
you asked for.

136
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,062
Oh, a minute 19.

137
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,984
Quick.

138
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,271
You were timing me?

139
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,032
Yes. I am going through
a bit of a timing phase.

140
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,992
How long will it last?

141
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,820
We'll find out.

142
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,455
What did you need the kit for?

143
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,658
Oh, er...

144
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,499
Sheldon was squatting down
to pick up a fork

145
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,171
and he ripped his pants.

146
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,251
Someone's gonna be sore tomorrow.

147
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,586
(DOOR SHUTS)

148
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,887
Quick thinking.

149
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,431
But for future lies,

150
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,429
this is as far as I can squat.

151
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,887
Penny gets 20 points
for the sewing kit.

152
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,393
Yeah, minus five,

153
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,940
because this is mine.

154
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,479
Well, she's still pulling
a commanding lead.

155
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,734
Did Bernadette even try
to send us a sewing kit?

156
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,192
She did.
Amazon, standard shipping,

157
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,776
not even Prime.

158
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,695
We could've done that ourselves.

159
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,031
(SCOFFS) That's what she said.

160
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,200
Maybe we're being old-fashioned,

161
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,251
defining these roles by gender.

162
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,371
You know, historically,
the best man's role

163
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,422
was to defend the bride
and groom in combat.

164
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,092
I mean, if that's not Penny,
I don't know what we're doing here.

165
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,220
I see your point.

166
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,350
Okay, we are officially open
to a best woman

167
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,268
and a gentleman of honor.

168
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,688
Oh! Those names are terrible.
One point off for you.

169
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,895
What am I being tested for?

170
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,773
Oh, it's not important.
But if you don't pass,

171
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,854
none of this matters.

172
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,111
Okay, what's the next test?

173
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,533
Loyalty.

174
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,781
We need to choose
someone who has our backs,

175
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,369
someone who will keep our
secrets even from each other.

176
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,458
Well, I don't have any secrets
from you.

177
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,126
Do you have secrets from me?

178
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,041
Yes.

179
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,381
Oh, that has been weighing
on me for years.

180
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,004
Come here.

181
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:08,052
Would you call yourself
a loyal and trustworthy friend?

182
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,600
- Yeah, I like to think so.
- Great.

183
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,095
Because I need to tell you
something about Howard,

184
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,971
but you can't tell him
that I told you.

185
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,807
Nope. Don't want to hear it.

186
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,938
Do not like to engage in gossip.

187
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,438
Okay. I respect your integrity.

188
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,190
Is it about his special underwear?

189
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,617
Because I already know.
And that's all I'll say.

190
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,205
Fine, it has a charcoal filter in it.

191
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,077
It's really sweet of you
to come by and keep me company.

192
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,912
Agreed.

193
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,296
So listen, I have a secret

194
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,093
<i>that I need to tell someone.</i>

195
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,555
But you can never say a word.

196
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,802
Not even to Howard.

197
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,804
I'm your girl. Lay it on me.

198
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,683
Really?
You keep things from your husband?

199
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,601
No, I tell him everything.

200
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,432
Don't be a child.

201
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,232
Okay. Here it is.

202
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,030
I can control the thermostat

203
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,609
in Leonard's apartment with my phone.

204
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,740
And when he makes me mad,

205
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,157
I turn it up, slightly.

206
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,915
Oh. Hey. I didn't know you were here.

207
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,621
What are you two talking about?

208
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,293
Literally, nothing interesting.

209
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,804
Oh, you're good.

210
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:35,682
Okay, getting to
the ceremony on time.

211
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,729
Leonard, quick.
I need you to get me

212
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,102
to Arcadia within the hour.

213
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,524
The train store's having a sale.

214
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,067
Why can't Amy drive you?

215
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,855
Because of the tradition
that I cannot see Amy

216
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,066
on the day of the train store sale.

217
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,990
Please, please see a doctor.

218
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,789
- Next test.
- Just wait one second.

219
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,713
Is it getting hot in here?

220
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,499
(CHUCKLING)

221
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,012
I'm sorry. Where were we?

222
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:14,015
How well do our friends know us?

223
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,060
So I was talking to my favorite aunt-

224
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,762
Aunt Doe, right?

225
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,806
Exactly.

226
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,691
Did she ever figure out what
that thing on her knee was?

227
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,611
Turns out it was a chocolate chip.

228
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,693
Mmm, makes sense, she does like to bake.

229
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:33,155
AMY: Yes, she does. Damn,
you are a thoroughbred.

230
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,455
You know, dealing with cold feet

231
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,706
is an important part of being
both best man and maid of honor.

232
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,295
Maybe we should test for that ability.

233
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,466
You really think
you might get cold feet?

234
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,636
Actually, I was talking about you.

235
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,547
Amy.

236
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:56,304
If there's one thing in
this world I'm sure of,

237
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,597
you are right to be worried.

238
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,396
Goodnight.

239
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:10,738
Howard, I've had my eye
on this limited edition Swamp Thing,

240
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,531
but now that I'm
about to buy it,

241
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,201
I'm having second thoughts.
What do you think?

242
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,621
I don't know, Sheldon,
it's pretty expensive.

243
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,996
Yes, but what if it will
make me happy, you know,

244
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,875
waking up and seeing it every
morning for the rest of my life?

245
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,674
(CHUCKLING)
Really, a walking clump of swamp grass?

246
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,589
Yeah, well, Bernadette's
no prize either!

247
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,885
Hey, what you doing?

248
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,060
Er, Sheldon gave me a brain-teaser.
It's kind of fun.

249
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,807
It's about a group of people at dinner,

250
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,389
and you have to figure out where
they can sit without fighting.

251
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,608
Yeah, is this
the one where Mr. Green

252
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,561
can't sit next to anyone eating meat,

253
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:50,896
and Uncle Light Blue

254
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,402
won't sit next to any
of the darker colors?

255
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,490
Yeah, did Sheldon send it to you?

256
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,036
Amy did.
I solved it already.

257
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,287
- Really?
- Yeah.

258
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,990
Same way I solved
my jury duty summons,

259
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,666
I threw it away.

260
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,910
No, no, no, no, no.

261
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,163
Aunt Orange can't sit next to the bar

262
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,543
without Ms. Pink saying,

263
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,084
"Jesus thinks you've
had enough whiskey."

264
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,971
Did Sheldon and Amy give
you guys that puzzle, too?

265
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,345
Yeah. ls it just me or
have they been acting strange?

266
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,685
I don't think they're acting.

267
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,980
Yeah, the other clay,
Sheldon made me

268
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,181
take him to the train store.

269
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,562
We didn't go inside.
He just said,

270
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,735
"Nicely done,"
and then we went home.

271
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,026
Yeah, and Amy gave me this plastic ring

272
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,402
and told me to hold on to it.

273
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,528
I got one, too.

274
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,359
- Yeah, same.
- Yeah, me, too.

275
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,616
But Cinnamon ate it.

276
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,908
I'll get it back tomorrow.

277
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,835
I have to say,
this is going pretty well.

278
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,002
It is.

279
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,460
If experimenting on humans
is morally wrong,

280
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,716
then I don't want
to be morally right.

281
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,635
Hey, are you testing us

282
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,592
to see who gets to be in your wedding?

283
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,557
- Yes.
- No.

284
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,309
They're rating us.

285
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,315
And I'm in last?

286
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,189
Don't panic, there's still time.

287
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,737
Look, it's a marathon, not a sprint.

288
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,607
You know what, this is so insulting.

289
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,158
I don't even want to be
your stupid best man.

290
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,485
- Yeah.
- Me neither.

291
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,740
Wait, wait.

292
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,447
Just out of curiosity,
which one of you figured it out?

293
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,374
I did.

294
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,665
Impressive.

295
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,881
Hello, Stuart.

296
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,510
Hey, Sheldon.
Can I interest you in a cappuccino?

297
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,974
When did you start selling those?

298
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,553
Someone left it here,
but it's still warm.

299
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,686
Want to say four bucks?

300
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,021
No, thank you.

301
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,611
Everything okay?

302
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,240
Well, I secretly
experimented on my friends,

303
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,818
and now none of them
want to be my best man.

304
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:05,288
So, you know,
normal wedding drama.

305
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,365
Sorry.

306
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,542
Probably have to use
my stupid brother.

307
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,370
So get ready for a wedding toast
delivered by his armpit.

308
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,172
Well, if you really don't
want to use your brother,

309
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,670
I'd be your best man.

310
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,512
- Really?
- Yeah, we're friends.

311
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,964
Plus, it'd be nice.

312
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,891
Never really been called
the best before.

313
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,596
Or a man, for that matter.

314
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:33,395
Okay, well, thank you, Stuart.

315
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,896
That's a very generous offer.

316
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,523
My pleasure.

317
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,028
I understand

318
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,983
the best man usually
receives a present.

319
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,822
That's true.

320
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,075
Can never have
too much Claritin.

321
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,541
You're still working on
Sheldon's dumb brain-teaser?

322
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,215
Oh, my God, Dr. Purple's
a woman! Of course!

323
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,382
Oh, that feels so good.

324
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,463
Hello.

325
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,888
I believe I owe the
three of you an apology.

326
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,060
No argument here.

327
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,185
By experimenting on you,

328
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,813
I realize I've violated your trust

329
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:19,612
and possibly the Geneva Convention.

330
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,822
Is that it?

331
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:22,990
No.

332
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,318
So as to not upset
any of you further,

333
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,574
I've asked Stuart
to be my best man,

334
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,870
and he's agreed.

335
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,078
Now, you're all still invited
to the bachelor party.

336
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,457
He's thinking Costco
and the theme is browsing.

337
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,960
You picked Stuart over one of us?

338
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,291
Well, I wanted to choose one of you,

339
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,920
but you all turned against me.

340
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:45,047
Picking a best man isn't
about keeping score.

341
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,843
But you're all my friends.

342
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,557
I mean, if I didn't collect data,

343
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,182
how could I possibly choose
among the three of you?

344
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,805
Well, that's actually kind of sweet.

345
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,100
Is it?
Then perhaps I said it wrong.

346
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,279
Look, this is your wedding,
just pick whoever you want.

347
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,402
You don't need to worry
about anyone else but yourself.

348
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,360
You've kind of been training
for this your whole life.

349
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,904
Thank you, Leonard.

350
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,823
And if it helps,
these two are quitters.

351
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,411
Hey, what you making?

352
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,338
Er. Well, I spilled the cheese packet,

353
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,257
-so we're having mac and nothing.
-(LEONARD SIGHS)

354
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,171
Yeah. I'll just have the mac.
"Nothing" gives me gas.

355
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,509
Why are you in such a good mood?

356
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:32,802
I just talked to Sheldon.

357
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,185
He apologized about the tests
and asked me to be his best man.

358
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,483
Great. After all you've done
for him, he should've asked you.

359
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,856
And Amy's your best friend.

360
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,983
I'm sure she'll come
to her senses and pick you.

361
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,072
Okay, she's not my best friend.
We're not 12.

362
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,740
If she wants Bernadette
to be her maid of honor,

363
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,942
I really don't care.

364
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,235
Sounds like you care.

365
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,116
No, I mean, it's just annoying.

366
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,368
You know, we talk every day.
We see each other all the time.

367
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,245
She's always there
for me, and basically...

368
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,372
Oh, my God,
Amy's my best friend.

369
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,626
You Okay?

370
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,425
No, my best friend didn't ask me
to be her maid of honor.

371
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,968
I'm pissed!

372
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:13,014
So, bottom line,
what you did was wrong and cruel,

373
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,721
which the mother of my children
finds oddly appealing.

374
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,437
So she still wants
to be my maid of honor?

375
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,813
Maid of honor, hit woman,
whatever you need.

376
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,815
Make the call.

377
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,072
Look, I know this is your wedding,

378
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,149
and you can do whatever you want,

379
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,530
but if you think anyone but me
is gonna be your maid of honor,

380
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,284
then you're an idiot because
you are my best friend.

381
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,702
- Too late. Bernadette...
- Bestie!

382
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,710
Stuart, I'm sorry if it's weird

383
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,011
Sheldon made me best man
instead of you.

384
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,469
It's okay.
I was best man for two whole days.

385
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,728
No one can take that away from me.

386
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,307
Except for Sheldon, when he did.

387
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,312
Although, if you want to be
a part of the wedding party,

388
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,692
I suppose you could be the flower girl.

389
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,571
Sold.

390
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,871
Well, I thought Halley
was gonna be the flower girl.

391
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,662
Oh. That's much better.
Sorry, Stuart, you're out.

392
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,751
Hey, so is Bernadette okay
with me being maid of honor?

393
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,753
Actually, I haven't
had the courage to tell her.

394
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,006
- I guess I should do that.
- Yeah.

your job is to make my life easier.

Hey, Stuart, you still
want in on this wedding?

401
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,649
Not that much.

(SIGHS) Fine, I'll do it.
