1
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:05,430
Hey, uh, who's free tonight?

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,345
- Oh, I think I'm--
- Hang on,

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,135
we've made this mistake before.

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,849
It's how we wound up
at his cousin Deepak's Tupperware party.

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:16,608
Hey, you use that collapsible bowl
all the time and you know it.

6
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,145
And it's not like that,

7
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,105
I just thought we could, you know,
hang out and go to a bar.

8
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:22,822
SHELDON: Very well.
HOWARD: That sounds fun.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,941
And watch cricket.

10
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,616
That sound you hear?
Ironically, crickets.

11
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,533
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Bert, how you doing?

12
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:33,867
Well, you know,

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,254
we geologists always get a little sad
when Rocktober's over.

14
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:40,795
- Wordplay?
- Yes.

15
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,338
- Funny wordplay?
- What do you think?

16
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:43,460
Eh.

17
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:44,628
Trust your gut.

18
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,883
Sheldon, I've got these
four billion-year-old meteorites.

19
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,345
I thought maybe they'd show signs
of neutrino interactions.

20
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,435
I could really use someone like you
to help me with the math.

21
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:59,773
Oh, so they would act as
natural dark matter detectors.

22
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:02,150
- That sounds interesting.
- It does,

23
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,526
but it's still geology.

24
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,910
Sorry, Bert, I don't have time
to play rocks with you.

25
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,578
I'm not asking you to play rocks.

26
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,156
I'm asking you to collaborate
on a research project.

27
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,831
Although, if there's time,

28
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,376
I guess we could play a round of
zinc, zinc, piece of quartz.

29
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,213
Does sound better than cricket.

30
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,218
Uh, thank you for asking. Unfortunately,
I have real science to do.

31
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,008
But you feel free to rock on.

32
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,509
That's how you do it.

33
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,008
All right.

34
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,057
Sheldon, what are you doing?
Bert's one of the top guys in his field.

35
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,065
And somewhere there's a mime
who's top in his field,

36
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,060
but you don't see me rushing
to collaborate with him

37
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,611
on new ways to be stuck in a box.

38
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,986
Yeah, also something I would watch
instead of cricket.

39
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,254
Oh, (CHUCKLES) hello.

40

Hey, Sheldon.

41
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,005
Yeah, I've been thinking about it

42
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,553
and I suppose I could help you
with your research.

43
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,047
What changed your mind?

44
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,301
Bert, I'm a gift horse.
Don't look me in the mouth.

45
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,349
Sorry. I'm happy you wanna help out.

46
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,601
If it's easier for you
we could just work at your office.

47
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,812
What? No, no, no. Not in my office, no.

48
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,484

ljust have to see
if my evenings are free.

That's a joke. They are.

Did you just come here to complain?

Yeah. That's the sport of my people.

Oh, that's Ravichandran Ashwin,
he's amazing.

He makes Hardik Pandya look like

I hope this isn't awkward.

- Hi.
- Are you here by yourself?

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,279
Yeah, I couldn't convince anyone
to come watch cricket with me.

Ah, that clears that up.

82

She's telling the bowler
to bowl a yorker.

83
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,310
It's the most brutal ball in cricket.

back-to-back yorkers.

I was there too. What a coincidence.

how many all-rounders you have.

Speaking of googlies, (CHUCKLES)
I'm gonna go.

96
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,057
I've been modeling different types
of dark matter

00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,011
and the traces they would leave
on the zircon inside your meteorite.

I call it the Cooper Boson.

They're very different.

Physics answers the question,
"What is the nature of the universe?"

then don't work with Bert.

No, but I like the work.

- Then work with him.
- Yeah, but I'm ashamed of the field.

- Then don't work with him.
- Yeah, but we could prove dark matter.

- Then work with him.
- But I just think that people--

How many times are you gonna do this?

152
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,084
My record is 14.

153

Okay, (SIGHS) this is about science,
why'd you come to me?

154

my reputation.

00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,393
"Checkered past"?

158
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,518
L's a figure of speech referring to
how sexually promiscuous you were.

159
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,406
Really? Well, I've got
a figure of speech

160
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,234
about how sexually promiscuous
you can go be with yourself.

161
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,239
And what is it?

162
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,836
Look, while Bernadette's on bed rest

163
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,913
we're gonna have to divide and conquer.

164
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,341
I've got one monitor for her,
one for the baby.

165
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,464
Which do you want?

166
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,928
I'll take the baby,
she's less emasculating.

167
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,017
Good morning. Scones?

168
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,057
- Ah, thanks.
- They're all for you,

169
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,729
I already had breakfast at Ruchi's.

170
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,140
You're kidding. You slept with her?

171
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,149
Well, there wasn't
a lot of sleeping involved.

172
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,436
I mean, she slept, I stayed awake.

173
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,068
I was afraid of snoring
'cause I didn't have my special pillow.

174
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,691
BERNADETTE: Howard!

175
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,492
<i>Can you help me to the bathroom?</i>

176
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,663
(SIGHS) At least the romance
is still alive.

177
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,501
- So...
-(RAJESH SIGHS)

178
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,870
You and Ruchi.

179
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,463
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I know you liked her too.

180
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,916
But we just bumped into each other
last night and hit it off.

181
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,884
Hmm, no, that's fine.

182
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,423
You're my friend and I'm happy for you.

183
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,886
Oh, thank you, Stuart.

184
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,260
Plus, I don't know how you're gonna
screw it up, but I know you will.

185
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,301
What's there to screw up?

186
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,598
She just wants to keep things casual.

187
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,304
Oh, great. That's how you're gonna
screw it up.

188
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,390
Hey, I can be casual.

189
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,693
Mmm-hmm. I should get a haircut,
this thing's going south fast.

190
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,194
So, Ruchi and I decided
to keep things casual.

191
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,608
(SCOFFS)

192
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,122
Wait-- What? I can handle casual.

193
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,619
(SCOFFS)

194
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,788
Why do you keep doing that
with your face?

195
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,537
Because you keep saying
stupid things with yours.

196
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,915
Okay, fine,

197
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,250
I'm not great at casual relationships

198
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,758
and I don't wanna scare her off.

199
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,336
All right.
Just give her some space, all right.

200
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,716
Don't call, don't text, don't e-mail.

201
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:51,425
That's crazy. What if I see a sunset
that reminds me of her?

202
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,346
All right, when do you see her next?

203
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,768
Uh, we're having dinner tonight.

204
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,311
Okay.

205
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,150
Put a rubber band around your wrist

206
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,650
and any time you start planning
your wedding or naming your children,

207
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,194
I want you to stab yourself
in the hand with a fork.

208
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,746
What's the rubber band for?

209
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:14,994
To slow the bleeding.

210
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,753
Hey, how's Bernadette handling bed rest?

211
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:25,258
Well, she lies around all day
eating Mallomars and hollering at me,

212
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,387
so her transformation from
my wife to my mother is complete.

213
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,809
Congratulations, I know
that's what you were hoping for.

214
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,724
Hey, Sheldon, you left your jacket
in my office last night.

215
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,518
(STAMMERING) No, I didn't.
That's not my jacket.

216
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,903
Then why does it say
"Property of S. Cooper,

217
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,105
"stop touching it"?

218
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,113
That sounds like someone named Scooper
doesn't want you touching his jacket.

219
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,997
Are you guys working together
on that meteorite project?

220
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,575
(SIGHS) Yes, fine. You found me out.

221
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,119
I'm doing geology.

222
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,665
Just, please, don't tell anyone.

223
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,084
Are you embarrassed of me?

224
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,961
Oh, no, no, no. Not you.

225
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,419
No, just the work that
you've devoted your entire life to.

226
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,682
If you're ashamed to be working with me
then I don't wanna work with you.

227
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,928
Sheldon, that was pretty rude.

228
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,437
Yeah, well, what do you expect,
he's a geologist.

229
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,817
- This place seems nice.
- Yeah, uh,

230
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,737
but not too nice.
Yelp called it "good for groups."

231
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,695
- Would you care to buy the lady a--
- No! Get out of here.

232
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,533
(CHUCKLES) Sorry about that.

233
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,877
ljust-- I hate when someone assumes
two people are dating

234
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,626
just because they look like they would
make beautiful babies together.

235
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,625
Are you sure you're okay with this?

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,172
Honestly, Ruchi,

237
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,967
I don't have a lot of experience
with casual relationships.

238
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,765
I have some experience
with serious relationships

239
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,302
and a ton of experience
with no relationships.

240
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,978
- You're funny.
- Glad it came off that way. (CHUCKLES)

241
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,402
Uh, so, tell me about your day.

242
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,861
How's work going?

243
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,574
Well, I spent the morning reviewing
side effects for our fungal cream,

244
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,196
so it was lot of ooze and pus...

245
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,871
(MIKE RENO & ANN WILSON'S
"ALMOST PARADISE" PLAYING)

246
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:29,048
And then I had to catalog it by color,

247
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,505
viscosity

248
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,338
and percentage of blood.

249
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,978
Sounds wonderful.

250
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,151
- Hey.
- Hmm.

251
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,521
Whatcha got there?

252
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:52,860
(SIGHS)

253
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,065
A rock.

254
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,027
Did some mean boys throw it at you?

255
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,123
It turns out I'm the mean boy.

256
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,543
Although I did drop it on my own foot,
so, kind of.

257
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,459
What's going on?

258
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,629
What if there was something
I wanted to do,

259
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,049
but I was worried other people
would think less of me?

260
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,347
Is that other person me
and does it happen in the bedroom,

261
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,595
in which case, I think I'm cool with it?

262
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,513
No.

263
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,191
It's about working with Bert on...

264
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,727
You know what,
I'm not even gonna say it.

265
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,404
I am just gonna say
the letter it starts with

266
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,818
and "ology."

267
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,532
G... Oh, no, that's not gonna work.

268
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,029
- Geology?
- Yes.

269
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,912
But we parted ways because
I was worried about my reputation.

270
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,038
(SIGHS)

271
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,118
Sheldon,

272
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,999
you've never cared what people thought.

273
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:52,002
Even when you really, really should.

274
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,636
That dinner with my parents
comes to mind.

275
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,548
If I'm not gonna use "your momma" jokes
when I meet your mother,

276
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,349
why'd I bother to learn them?

277
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,471
I'm just saying,

278
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,057
if you think the work is interesting,

279
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,437
nothing else should matter.

280
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,482
You're right, Amy.

281
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,821
That is sage advice.

282
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,075
Which is surprising considering
your momma is so dumb, she--

283
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,367
Nope.

284
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,036
She studied for a urine test. (LAUGHS)

285
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,798
I was supposed to go back
to India and get married,

286
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,795
but I realized it wasn't what I wanted.

287
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,465
So I called off the engagement
and moved out here.

288
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,005
Well, if he wasn't your soulmate,
he wasn't your soulmate.

289
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,009
Oh, God, please tell me
you're not one of those.

290
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,643
One of what?

291
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,601
I wanna say "teenage girls,"

292
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,022
but that sounds mean.

293
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,852
Come on. You don't believe that
everyone has one perfect match?

294
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,605
Of course not. That's ridiculous.

295
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,490
I mean, what if your soulmate
lived halfway across the world?

296
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,609
- You'd never meet.
- Yes, you would.

297
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,035
I can give you, like, 20 examples

298
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,488
where that happened
to Kate Hudson alone.

299
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,950
You know what, people get upset
when I talk about this.

300
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,034
Let's just change the subject.

301
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,581
No, no, no. No, it's fine.

302
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,382
Are you saying that you don't believe
two people fall in love?

303
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,092
Of course, they do.
It's just that what people call "love"

304
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,925
is actually a series of
biochemical reactions in the brain

305
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,088
that fade over time.

306
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,971
Ah, yes. Like the old song,

307
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,595
<i>When a Man Has a Biochemical Reaction
for a Woman.</i>

308
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,102
Raj, we're scientists.

309
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,442
We don't need to feel threatened
just because we understand

310
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,861
the mechanisms that give rise
to romantic feelings.

311
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,735
It doesn't take anything away
from the experience.

312
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,194
Yes, it does.

313
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,402
Actually, it takes everything
away from it.

314
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,953
Love isn't just science, okay.

315
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,371
(STAMMERS) It's spiritual.

316
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,329
It's an acknowledgment of a mystery
that's greater than ourselves.

317
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,169
It's what makes people
write songs and poems

318
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:56,498
and what has kept The Bachelor on TV
for 21 magical seasons.

319
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,716
Don't you think the fact

320
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,090
that love is given away
as a prize on a game show

321
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,679
slightly undermines your argument?

322
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,095
Uh, yes, but I've
never missed an episode

323
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,889
and I dare science to explain that.

324
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,145
Bert? Bert, Bert?

325
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,235
Bert, Bert, Bert?

326
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,359
What do you want, Sheldon?

327
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,740
I would like us to work together again.

328
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,361
And I promise to keep
my geology comments to myself

329
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,492
because while some of them are funny,

330
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,788
all of them are mean.

331
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,334
Well, this is awkward.

332
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,051
Leonard, what are you doing here?

333
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,510
Bert asked for my help.

334
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,421
Yeah. He's an excellent scientist

335
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,924
and he doesn't tell me
what time I can go to the bathroom.

336
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,602
It's called bladder training,

337
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,763
and when you're in your 80s
you'll thank me for it.

338
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,192
Look, Sheldon, you were a jerk to Bert,
and he walked away from you.

339
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,528
So I feel like there's a lot
he could teach me.

340
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,731
Bert, please.

341
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,739
(SIGHS) I know I behaved poorly
in the past,

342
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,157
but things will be different this time.
You'll see.

343
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:10,746
Come on.

344
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,031
Let me in.

345
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,831
We'll have some laughs,

346
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,208
we'll calculate some isotope ratios.

347
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:23,918
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

348
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,838
(DOOR CLOSES)

349
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,382
So, you just shut the door in his face?

350
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,012
I gotta start writing this stuff down.

351
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,892
I mean, Ruchi is nice,

352
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,265
we're just so different.

353
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,314
I know. Sometimes when you're dating
you meet weird people.

354
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,482
I once met a girl
who didn't like juggling. (CHUCKLES)

355
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,564
And she still doesn't.

356
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,075
So you're not gonna see her again?

357
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,034
(SIGHS) What's the point? We're never
gonna be in a real relationship.

358
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,957
Right. So you'll only be
in a physical one?

359
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,293
Exactly. Why would I wanna spend time
with someone like that?

360
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,962
Someone who is just interested in sex?

361
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,130
Yeah.

362
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,214
- Raj, do you really--
- Wait! Hold on, give him a chance.

363
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,340
He's gonna get this.

364
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:10,798
I don't think he is.

365
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,388
What is there to get?

366
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,556
She doesn't want to fall in love.

367
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,304
At that point, all we are

368
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,731
is two single people who find
each other attractive and enjoy having--

369
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,224
Oh, gotta go. (CLEARS THROAT)

370
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,240
So, how was your night with Ruchi?

371
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,868
Oh, great. We ordered in some food,

372
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,445
we had sex, I left.

373
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,080
I didn't even ask if she enjoyed it.

374
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,247
(HOWARD CHUCKLES)

375
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,409
I can field that one for her.

376
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,705
I mean, I did get a little misty
when we said goodbye,

377
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,214
but I played it off as allergies.

378
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,373
I don't know if she bought it.

379
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,126
Again, I know.

380
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,008
Sheldon?

381
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,927
You Okay?

382
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,215
Sheldon.
