LEONARD: Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:07,467
I was offered a summer research
fellowship at Princeton.

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:09,510
A fine institution.

4
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,438
The place where Albert Einstein taught.

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,146
And where Leonard got his PhD,
so it may have gone downhill.

6
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,570
Gentlemen, you may remember
Dr. Nowitzki,

7
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,984
she's back at Caltech for her post-doc.

- RAMONA: Hello. (CHUCKLES)
- ALL: Hi.

9
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,029
Question,

10
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,404
are you seeking
a romantic relationship with me?

11
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,197
What if I were?

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,413
Well, that would raise
a number of problems.

13
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,378
We're colleagues,
I'm currently in a--

14
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,678
SHELDON: Amy. (KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Amy. Amy.

15
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,309
Will you marry me?

16

(SHELDON'S CELL PHONE RINGING)

17
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,193
One moment please.

18
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,617
Really, you're gonna
answer that right now?

19
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,078
It's Leonard, I don't want to be rude.

20
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,248
- Hello?
- Hey, where you been?

21
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,575
We've been calling you for hours.

22
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,453
I'm sorry,
my phone was on airplane mode.

23
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,537
Why?

24
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,709
Because I was on an airplane.

25
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,790
(MOUTHING)

26
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,841
Hey, put him on speaker.

27
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,544
- Yeah.
- Hey. Where are you?

28
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,838
SHELDON: <i>I</i> came to Princeton to see Amy.

29
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,928
(CHUCKLES) It's a funny story actually.

30
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,726
I was having lunch with Dr. Nowitzki

31
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,978
-and she kissed me.
- Excuse me?

32
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,179
Rm sorry?

33
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,937
Wait, and in that moment I realized that

34
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,607
Amy was the only woman
I ever wanted to kiss

35
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,188
for the rest of my life.

36
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,859
So, I came to New Jersey
to ask her to marry me.

37
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,868
- Oh, that's so sweet.
-(CHUCKLES)

38
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,365
Sheldon.

39
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,870
Yeah, although there was one man
whose blessing I needed first.

40
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,288
I've thought about it

41
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,039
and I really wanna spend
the rest of my life with Amy.

42
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,669
Do I have your blessing?

43
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,668
<i>Well, Sheldon,</i>

44
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,094
<i>I think you should make
her finger like Saturn</i>

45
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,845
<i>and put a ring on it.</i>

46
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,222
You asked Stephen Hawking
and not her father?

47
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,232
Stephen Hawking's a genius.

48
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,068
If he said no, I wasn't gonna waste
my time on her father.

49
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,404
But you did ask my father?

50
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,611
- Mm-hmm, I did, he said, "Yes."
-(GASPS)

51
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,068
Although not in a robot voice
so it wasn't nearly as cool.

52
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,450
Okay, oh, my God, I can't believe
you guys are engaged!

<i>SHELDON: We're not engaged yet,</i>

54
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,328
she's taking forever to answer.

55
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,875
Because you're on the phone!

56
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,837

Mother, I have some good news to share.

We're engaged! (CHUCKLES)

63
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,004
I am so happy for you two.
But I'm not surprised.

64
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,300
I've been praying for this.

65
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,253
Well, God had nothing to do with it.

66
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,969
It happened because
I was kissing another woman

67
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:37,305
and it made me realize
I wanted to be with Amy.

68
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,644
More than one woman
was interested in you?

69
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,188
I might have prayed a little too hard.

70
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,271
(STUTTERS) I just-- I wanna
let you know right now

71
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,148
that we are not getting married
in a church.

72
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,031
That's all right, Sheldon,
anywhere Jesus is is a church.

73
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,441
Well, he won't be at our wedding.

74
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,657
He's in my heart,
so if I'm there he'll be there.

75
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,201
Okay, well, then he's your plus one,
you don't get to bring anyone else.

That's fine, love you.

with that part of the story.

Interesting.

Howard's gonna lose his mind.

107

Wait, you haven't told him yet?

108
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,256
- No.
- So you told me first?

109

Oh, Bernie.

110
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,974
This wasn't supposed to happen.
We were careful.

111
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,014
I didn't even think you could get
pregnant while you were breastfeeding.

112
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,887
Well, guess what, you can.

Hey, look, this is a good thing.

114

Hailey's gonna have
a little brother or sister to play with.

115
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,690
I guess that would be pretty cute.

116
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,731
And, you know,
I was a surprise to my parents,

117
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,363
and my dad said it was the best thing
that ever happened to them.

118
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,904
Okay, maybe this baby
actually is a blessing.

119

Oh, my God, honey, of course it is.

- How am I pregnant again?
- Yeah, what were you thinking?

121
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,504
All right.
I'm all checked into my flight.

122
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,798
Well I'm sad you're leaving,

123
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,762
Why'd you only book a flight
for one day?

124
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,140
I came here to propose.

125
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:23,766
If you'd said "No;-

126
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,890
I wouldn't want to stick around
looking at your stupid face.

127
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:32,142
Now, mind you, your face is only stupid
in the "no" version of the story.

128
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,980
But I said, "Yes,"
so I get a lifetime of this.

129
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,691
Yes, you do, smart face.

130
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,902
Why don't you stay a few extra days?

131
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,241
Well, I don't have any other clothes.

132
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,655
We'll get you some.

133

I don't know, I'm pretty particular.

134

Well, there's a comic book store
less than a mile from here.

135
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,787
Perfect, let's go shopping.

136
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,466
Oh, um, and I'm having dinner
with some colleagues tonight,

137
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,134
I'm sure they'd love to meet you.

138
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,674

- Come on. What do you say?

Aw, you're nagging me.

140
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,888
It's like we're already married.

141
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,347
- Is that a "yes" or a "no"?
- Geez, save some for the honeymoon.

142
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,352
Look at Nowitzki over there.

143
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,571
Can't believe she tried to steal
Sheldon from Amy.

144
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,325
You know what? I'm gonna go there
and tell her that they're engaged now

145
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,947
and that her little plan didn't work.

146
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,411
Because you're sticking up for Sheldon,

147
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,239
or because you're still mad
she rejected you?

148
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,824
Too far away, can't hear you.

149
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,210
- Hello, Ramona.
- Hello.

150
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,752
Why are you sitting by yourself?

151
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:40,548
Oh, that's right, Sheldon's
in New Jersey, being engaged to Amy.

152
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,421
I heard.

153
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,093
Now that Sheldon's out of the picture,

154
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,551
I could give you one more chance
to go out with me.

155
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,766
Nope, I'm good.

156
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,100
You sure?

157
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,444
I will not ask again.

158
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,196
I sincerely hope not.

159
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,531
Very well. I'm going to leave
before this gets awkward.

160
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,667
Hey. Want me to make dinner?

161
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,953
All right. Sure, but first,
why don't you have a seat.

162
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,288
There is something I need to show you.

163
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:21,173
Ooh, if it's "How to make dinner"
that'd be great. (LAUGHS)

164
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,754
(SIGHS)

165
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,809
Is this a...

166
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,223
pregnancy test?

167
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,221
Yes.

168
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,813
That means...

169
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,982
positive?

170
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,610
Yes.

171
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,571
No.

172
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,249
- Yes.
- Oh, no, no. (LAUGHS)

173
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:55,915
Yes.

174
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,288
No.

175
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,090
How could this even happen?

176
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,298
(STUTTERS) I mean, we were careful.

177
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,381
Well, it did.

178
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,807
- No! No!
- Yes! Yes!

179
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,510
- No! No! No!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

180
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,187
Okay, okay, okay, (GASPS) well, wh--
what are-- what are we gonna do?

181
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,476
What do you mean,
"What are we gonna do?"

182
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,556
We're gonna have another baby.

183
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,107
- No.
- Stop that!

184
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,901
- No! I'm trying!
- Yes.

185
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,777
(SIGHS) Look, I know it's scary,

186
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,154
but we're both responsible adults,

187
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,401
we can do this.

188
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,903
(SIGHS) You really think so? (SIGHS)

189
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,158
Yeah.

190
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,952
No!

191
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,661
Hey, Stuart.

192
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,418
Oh, hey, Raj, what can I help you with?

193
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,499
I need to buy an engagement gift.

194
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,751
Well, you came to the wrong place.

195
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,470
(CHUCKLES) It's for Sheldon and Amy.

196
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,051
No way, they're engaged?

197
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,174
- Yeah.
- Ah, that's exciting news.

198
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,678
Who would've thought Sheldon and Amy
would be the next two to tie the knot.

199
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,602
Tell me about it.
I'm the one who caught the bouquet

200
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,102
at Leonard and Penny's wedding.

201
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,435
Okay, uh, you know,

202
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,521
they might like this,

203
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,783
Superman and Wonder Woman.
It's kinda romantic.

204
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,406
Mm.

205
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,111
You know what,

206
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,454
why am I buying them a gift?

207
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,119
They have love,
screw them and their happiness.

208
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,243
What do you have for someone
who's bitter and alone?

209
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,880
Literally, everything.

210
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,794
Sheldon, these are the heads
of my research team.

211
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,511
- Hello.
- Dr. Zane, Dr. Harris,

212
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,305
this is my fiancé,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

213
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,350
That's the first time I've said that
and it kinda gave me the goosebumps.

214
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,855
Dr. Cooper, we are so excited
to meet you. (CHUCKLES)

215
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,523
Oh, well that's very kind of you.

216
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,520
If you'd like, I could
autograph your menus after dinner. Yeah.

217
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,029
But I better not see those on eBay.

218
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,689
(DR. ZANE LAUGHS)

219
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,274
No, no, no. We're, we're just excited

220
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,610
to meet the man
who landed this brilliant woman here.

221
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,782
-(CHUCKLES)
- Oh, that wasn't hard,

222
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,205
she threw herself at me.

223
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,952
Now getting the universe
to show me its naughty bits,

224
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,498
that took some doing.

225
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,623
Sheldon's a physicist.

226
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,587
- Oh.
- That's nice.

227
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,005
Amy, I recently read your paper

228
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,466
on lesions in the olfactory receptors
in the brain.

229
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,392
(SIGHS) It was inspired.

230
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,812
(CHUCKLES)
Well, I guess it didn't stink.

231
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,805
But if it did, that rat wouldn't
have known it. (CHUCKLES)

232
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,232
(DR. ZANE LAUGHS)

233
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,526
(STUTTERS) I'm sorry, I'm sure
you don't wanna sit here

234
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,023
and listen to a bunch of work talk.

235
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,439
Oh, no, I love it. (STUTTERS)
Let's talk about work.

236
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,110
<i>Amy's work, my work,</i>

237
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,574
yeah, why don't we start with my work?

238
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,824
Actually, I do have a question
for Dr. Cooper.

239
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,615
When Amy first told you
about her approach to synaptic tracing,

240
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,084
did you think it was gonna
revolutionize the field?

241
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,499
(STUTTERS) Really,

242
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,038
that's your question?

243
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,835
<i>What are you, Entertainment Tonight?</i>

244
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,335
You know what? (STUTTERS)
I'm gonna give you a better question.

245
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,212
Here, "Dr. Cooper,

246
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,099
"I heard you were working on a top
secret project for the U.S. Military,

247
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,221
"why don't you tell us about that?"

248
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,143
See, that's a great question.

249
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,305
Okay, what was that like?

250
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,607
Well, I can't tell you that,
it's top secret.

251
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,034
Boy, that was exhausting.

252
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,988
And no offense, but your colleagues
were pretty rude.

253
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,584
- Really, they were rude?
- Yes,

254
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,537
they just kept talking about you
and how great you are

255
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,664
no matter how many times
I brought me up.

256
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,842
Well, these are my colleagues,
and they wanna talk about my work,

257
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,462
why does that bother you so much?

258
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,680
Because I was there.

259
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,924
It's like having Optimus Prime
over to dinner

260
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,725
and not asking him to turn into a truck.

261
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,017
You know what, Sheldon?

262
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,557
You're not always the smartest person
in every room.

263
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,022
You may not even be the smartest person
in this room.

264
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,110
Oh, I am sorry.

265
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,359
What, is Neil Degrasse Tyson
hiding behind the couch?

266
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,484
Because if he is, he's not that smart.
It's pretty dusty back there.

267
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:00,996
Hey, where are you going?

268
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,786
I'm storming off to my room.

269
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,909
Wait, then where am I supposed
to storm off to?

270
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,745
Well, you're so smart,
why don't you figure it out?

271
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:09,588
(DOOR CLOSES)

272
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,088
ls there another bedroom?

273
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,429
Perhaps (STUTTERS) a den?

274
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:25,518
So, how are you guys doin'
with all the new events in your womb?

275
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,483
Good, you know,
obviously it was a surprise.

276
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,114
There was some crying
and some yelling--

277
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,824
Some suggestion of make-up sex

278
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,243
that did not go over well even though
it's not like we can get more pregnant.

279
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,201
But then we realized
that it's a gift, in the sense that

280
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,999
we didn't ask for it,
and we may not have chosen it--

281
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,417
(CHEWING) And we already have one.

282
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,463
You know, whenever I find a top I like

283
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,262
I always go back and get a second one
in a different color.

284
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,845
Which I hope is not the case
with your baby.

285
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,059
Uh, uh, I know you guys are freaked out
but you're great parents

286
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,232
and if you ever need help
we are here for you.

287
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,109
Yeah. Anything at all, just ask.

288
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,278
Well, you know what you could do?

289
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:19,951
You could have a baby, too.

290
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:25,994
I'm sorry, what?

291
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,752
Well, that's a great idea.
We could go through it together,

292
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,828
wouldn't that be fun?

293
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,171
(SCOFFS)

294
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,417
You guys were just saying
how freaked out and miserable you are.

295
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,467
I say a lot of crazy things,
I'm pregnant and hormonal.

296
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,632
Do it, have a baby, do it!

297
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,303
Come on, it'd be so cute,
our kids playing together.

298
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,685
What do you say? Why don't you two hit
the old mattress and whip up a family?

299
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,898
Okay, we're not gonna have a baby
just to make you guys feel better.

300
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,113
Yeah, if we're gonna have a baby
it's gonna be when we are ready

301
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,735
or when I'm certain
Penny's gonna leave me.

302
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,108
Exactly.

303
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,622
They're my friends,
and I should be happy for them.

304
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,865
And I'm trying,

305
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:12,086
but, all I feel is this, like,
gnawing empty sensation in my gut.

306
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,005
- I had that once.
- Hmm.

307
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,874
Turned out it was a tapeworm.

308
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,011
Cool, uh...

309
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,388
It's just--

310
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,721
It's hard talking
to my other friends about this,

311
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,972
but I knew you would understand.

312
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,062
- Why is that?
- Because you and I are both alone,

313
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,061
which is actually kind of comforting

314
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,938
Because at least
we can be alone together.

315
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,483
(INHALES) Hmm, this is,
this is awkward. I, um,

316
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:40,861
I was actually gonna <i>close</i> up a little
early tonight 'cause I have a date.

317
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,076
- Really?
- Yeah.

318
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,078
<i>(CLEARS THROAT)</i>

319
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:49,624
Forgive me if I'm having trouble
being happy for you.

320
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,869
Don't be silly, I'm lovin' your pain.

321
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,375
Is this how our marriage is going to be?

322
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,012
Sometimes people will be more interested
in talking to her than to me?

323
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,139
<i>Are you sitting in a bathroom?</i>

324
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,059
(SIGHS) Yes,

325
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,516
I needed a place to storm off to
and it was all that was available.

326
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,358
<i>Fine, but if I hear a flush</i>

327
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,484
<i>this conversation is over.</i>

328
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,781
Those people were in the presence
of a world-class mind

329
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,404
and all they wanted to talk about
was their own nonsense.

330
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,995
<i>Can you see the irony in that statement?</i>

331
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,207
STEPHEN HAWKING: How about now?

332
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,705
<i>HAWKING: How about now?</i>

333
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,000
<i>I'll wait.</i>

334
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,797
Oh, surprise.

335
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,091
Oh, crap, is it our anniversary?

336
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,223
No. Wait.

337
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,649
- No.
- No. Okay.

338
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,817
All right, so what are we celebrating?

339
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,271
Well, Bernadette and Howard
are pregnant again,

340
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,114
Amy and Sheldon are getting married,

341
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,528
I didn't want you to feel left out.

342
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:05,650
Oh.

343
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,825
Left out?

344
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,869
Well, Bernadette has to grow
a baby inside of her

345
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,243
and Amy has to marry one.
My life is great!

346
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,991
(LAUGHS)

347
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,331
- So do you not want the cake--
- Try and take it away, see what happens.

348
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,296
Oh, crap, it is our anniversary.

349
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,756
Happy anniversary!

350
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,762
Amy...

351
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,723
There's something I need to say to you.

352
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,018
I'm listening.

353
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,306
(SIGHS)

354
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,354
I've been thinking about The Avengers.

355
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,855
I believe that,

356
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,070
but I don't think that's something
you needed to say to me.

357
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,401
(SIGHS)

358
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,579
I realized that Iron Man is great.

359
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,995
And also, that Captain America is great.

360
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,749
And sometimes Iron Man
is in a Captain America movie

361
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,832
and he's not mad
it's not an Iron Man movie.

362
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,794
Now he can fly in, give the audience
a thrill, and then fly away.

363
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,925
And that should have been me tonight.

364
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,054
I should have been
the delightful cameo in your movie.

365
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,304
Thank you, Sheldon.

366
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,515
Instead, I was like the Hulk and I--

367
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,225
Okay, please stop talking
about The Avengers.

368
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,603
Anyway,

369
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:25,946
I'm proud of you

370
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,909
and I'm going to try to do a betterjob
of sharing the spotlight

371
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,069
because we're a team,

372
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,075
you know, much like...

373
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,616
The Dodgers.

374
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,499
If they had superpowers.

375
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,005
And fought crime.

376
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,750
And Thor was in them.

377
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,676
Sheldon, I know this isn't easy,

378
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,008
but, you'll have a whole lifetime
to practice.

379
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,515
It could take that long,
I'm really bad at it.

380
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,732
You know, maybe, um...

381
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,024
I should start right now

382
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,857
and go back to Pasadena and let you have
this experience to yourself.

383
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,484
You just want to go back

384
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,365
'cause that's where everybody
makes a fuss over you.

385
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,742
You know, your colleagues are right,
you are brilliant.

386
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,965
Hello.

387
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,212
- Hey!
- Mm, hey, welcome back!

388
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,626
Oh, (STUTTERS) let me see the ring.

389
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,965
RAJESH: Ooh, nice.

390
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,638
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
her eyes are up there.

391
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,714
(CHUCKLES)

392
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,677
I-is that the woman who kissed Sheldon?

393
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,641
Uh.

394
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,934
- Could be.
- Hard to say.

395
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,356
Tell us about Princeton.

396
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:45,894
- Excuse me for a minute.
- Yeah. No, we'll catch up later.

397
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:49,071
This is going to be
the biggest smackdown

398
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,069
since my Aunt Noopur
showed up at the family reunion

399
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,196
wearing the same sari
as my cousin Shruti.

400
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,530
Dr. Nowitzki.

401
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,790
Oh. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

402
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,868
Dr. Fowler,

403
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,285
hello.

404
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,331
Thank you. Thank you so much.

405
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,012
