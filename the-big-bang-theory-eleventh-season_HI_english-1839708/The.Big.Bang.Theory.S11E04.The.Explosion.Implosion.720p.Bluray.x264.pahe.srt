but I don't have a lot of
what you would call "girlfriends."

158
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,933
(SARCASTICALLY) What?

159
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,855
Of course,
there are my female colleagues,

160
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,898
but they're all Freudians,

161
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,148
so the only boy
that I can dish about is my father.

162
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,854
(LAUGHS)

163
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,612
Well, you know, I'm here for you.
What do you wanna talk about?

164
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:52,036
Well, last time we focused on my life.

165
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,915
If we're going to be real girlfriends,
we should talk about you as well.

166
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,121
Well, you know,
if we're going to be real girlfriends,

167
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,298
we should get a third girl
we can trash behind her back.

168
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,757
Oh, so we'd be catty.

169
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,383
I like it.

170
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,968
What about Sheldon's fiancée?
She seems a bit dour.

171
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,564
Ooh, "Dour." Meow.

172
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,321
All right, here we go.

173
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,903
L-minus ten, nine--

174
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,984
Wait, what are you doing? It's T-minus.

175
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,369
I was an astronaut, we used L-minus.

176
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,659
Yeah, but this is a Saturn V

177
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,491
and when they launched those,
they said T-minus.

178
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,289
It's my rocket, we're doing it my way.

179
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,621
Fine.

180
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,341
I'm not saying I know why your dad left

181
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,759
but I think I'm getting an idea.

182
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:52,009
L-minus ten, nine, eight, seven, six--

I thought I could (SIGHS)

do with my son,
I can't even do that right.

Sheldon, what am I gonna do?

about raising a boy?

Oh, my God, you're right.

Why?

213
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,737
Is she sick of talking
to the magic mirror on the wall?

214
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,492
No, I think she's lonely.
She's been reaching out.

Okay, just be careful.

216

You think you're getting close to her,
the next thing you know,

217
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,325
you're featured in a book called

<i>He's Doing It On Purpose:
Raising a Teenage Bedwetter.</i>

No, it's not like that.

220
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,083
You know, she's been opening up
about her life

00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,340
and she's actually been
really supportive about mine.

- Really?
- Yeah.

223
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,966
I've been telling her about my job
and she said she was proud of me.

224
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,726
That's great.

225
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,390
Never told me she was proud of me.

Even when I stayed dry
for a whole month.

Do you not want me
to be friends with your mom?

228

Well, the-- Let's be clear,

Reason number 13 to feel good.

00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,582

but as an explosion, it was glorious.

be able to cheer me up.

Well, how about this, then?

you're going to get this riddle.

Oh, hey. Hey, what do you think?

252
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,359
Just because it's a boy,

253
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,938
I don't think you need to put a picture
of genitals on his shirt.

What? That's a baseball bat
with two little baseballs.

Okay, yeah, now I see it.

256
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,072
So, you know,

00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,292
I understand why Howard
is nervous about having a son,

258
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,748
but are you really upset about it?

259
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,287
No, I'm fine.

260
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,877
It's just, I grew up
with a bunch of brothers, so,

261
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,042
I thought it'd be nice
for Halley to have a sister.

262
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,297
Is that wrong?

263
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,136
Of course, it's wrong.

264
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,255
You don't know what this little boy
is gonna be like.

265
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,299
Maybe he'll be rough and tumble

266
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,851
or maybe he'll be sweet and sensitive

267
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,808
or maybe he'll be
all those things, like me.

268
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,771
You're rough and tumble?

269
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,187
You bet I am, bitch.

270
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,076
But I'm also sensitive
and regret saying that.

271
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:27,867
- Hey.
- Hello.

272
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:29,786
You got a sec?

273
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,871
Sure, what's up?

274
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,841
Penny's been talking to my mother
like they're best friends

275
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,384
and it's kind of freaking me out.

276
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,586
Okay.

277
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,931
I'm pretty sure
they're not best friends.

278
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,722
'Cause you can only have
one best friend,

279
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,355
and Penny has that, and (TSKS) it's me.

280
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,860
Oh, really? ls she facetiming
with you right now?

281
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,524
Because she's facetiming with my mom

282
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,860
and believe me, that is not a face
you want to spend time with.

283
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,990
Hmm. Well, I have been
pretty busy lately.

284
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,330
Maybe I've been
neglecting our friendship.

285
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,794
Penny knows I have a complicated
relationship with my mother.

286
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,166
It's like she doesn't even care.

287
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,669
And with everything going on at the lab
and planning the wedding,

288
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,466
I just, I have so little free time.

289
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,966
Penny doesn't know how manipulative
my mother can be.

290
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,261
Did you know there's such a thing as
reverse, reverse, reverse psychology?

291
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,135
Because there is.

292
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,387
I mean, she must feel so abandoned.

293
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,139
She's used to me
being there all the time,

294
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,980
but now I have my own life
and she's just gonna have to accept it.

295
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,982
And why is my mom proud of Penny
and not me?

296
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,062
I mean, the real question is,

297
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,194
why is Penny so afraid of me
growing as a person?

298
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,315
I'm good at stuff too.

299
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,034
I deserve my own life!

300
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,622
- Okay, well, thanks.
- Yeah, good talk.

301
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,127
You know, studies have shown

302
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,255
that people distracted
by emotional issues

303
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,586
are poor drivers.

304
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,011
What about people distracted
by irritating passengers?

305
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,636
That would be hard to test

306
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,472
because irritating is
a subjective quality.

307
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,349
Strongly disagree.

00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,696
(SIGHS)

309
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,772
Can I drive?

310
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,823
No, (CHUCKLES) you can't drive,
you don't even have a license.

311
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,612
Actually, I do.

312
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,831
Really? Since when?

313
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,200
Three years ago.

314
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,748
I went on a bit of a license kick.

315
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,330
I'm also a commercial fisherman.

316
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,084
Then why don't you ever drive yourself?

317
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,427
Honestly, I barely passed my test.

318
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,221
And the one time I drove on my own,

319
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,846
I made a U-turn, got dizzy,
threw up and walked home.

320
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,145
You really want to drive?
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

321
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,140
This seems like the perfect time.

322
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,729
The roads are straight,
there's no one around

323
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,857
and you don't seem to care
if you live or die.

324
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,448
Live, Sheldon, I want to live.

325
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,444
That makes things a little trickier,
but I'll do my best.

326
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,993

327
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,792
<i>Hi, Pen-- Oh, hello, Leonard.</i>

328
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,792
Hello, Mother. How are you?

329
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,130
<i>Fine, and you?</i>

330
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,462
<i>-l'm great.
- Well, it's been lovely catching up.</i>

331
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,678
No, no, no. Wait, (STUTTERS)
hang on, we need to talk.

332
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,088
<i>Oh, brother.</i>

333
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,383
I wanna know,

334
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,052
why aren't you proud of me?

335
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,689
<i>Well, isn't the real question,
why aren't you proud of yourself?</i>

336
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,525
No. That is a question

337
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,147
and I ask it a lot.

338
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,234
But let's stick with the one
I asked you.

339
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,820
<i>Well, why do you think
I'm not proud of you?</i>

340
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,322
Because you never say it.

341
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,620
But two days into chatting with Penny

342
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,664
and you can't stop telling her
how great she is.

343
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,162
<i>She is great.</i>

344
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,244
<i>Honestly,
of all of my children's spouses,</i>

345
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,463
<i>she's the one
that I'm most impressed by.</i>

346
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,591
- Seriously?
- Yes.

347
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:08,179
<i>She's confident, she's thoughtful
and she never complained about you once.</i>

348
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,472
<i>I know what kind of strength that takes.</i>

349
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,018
So, Penny's your favorite?

350
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,055
<i>I suppose she is.</i>

351
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:21,522
<i>You married well, Leonard,
and for that I am proud of you.</i>

352
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,898
I don't-- I don't--
I don't know what to say.

353
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,531
<i>I'm also proud of
how hard you're trying not to cry.</i>

354
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,238
Thank you.

355
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,115
<i>Would you like to hang up now?</i>

356
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,374
Yeah, here it comes.

357
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,010
Your hands are at ten and two, good.

358
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,133
Steady on the gas.

359
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:51,840
Okay.

360
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:55,677
Now you're gonna wanna
slowly switch lanes.

361
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,053
Why?

362
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:00,603
Because there are only two
and you're not in either of them.

363
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,275
Attaboy. Well done.

364
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,648
Thank you.

365
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:12,452
Last time I drove,
I was terrified, but this is fun.

366
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,487
You're doing great.

367
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,072
You're a good teacher.

368
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,413
<i>(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)</i>

369
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,041
Your son is going to be lucky
to have you as a father.

370
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,539
Thanks.

371
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,795
Do you think
I could try going a little faster?

372
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,217
(SIGHS SOFTLY)

373
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,422
Go for it, champ.

374
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:34,883
<i>Ow.</i>

375
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,557
Sorry. Just ease on the gas and--

376
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,771
Oh! Too much, too much!

377
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,065
Why was I scared of this?
This is exhilarating.

378
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,566
No, it's not! Slow down!

379
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,311
Don't tell me what to do,
you're not my father.

380
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:58,869
Do you know how fast you were going?

381
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,282
A hundred and twelve.

382
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,453
Let me see your license.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

384
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,174
- Okay, here's the plan.
- No.

385
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:11,794
Fine.

386
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,587
There you go.

387
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,600
You know what, you can just keep it.
