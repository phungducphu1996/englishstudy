RAJ: If Bruce Banner is driving
a rental car and turns into the Hulk,

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,766
do you think he's covered or

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,641
does he need to
add the Hulk as an additional driver?

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,107
You really need a girlfriend.

5
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,145
(GASPING) Mailman's here!

6
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,445
Aw. Remember when he used to
get that excited to see us?

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,035
Do you have any mail
for Doctor Sheldon Cooper?

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,990
I do, but I can't hand it right to you,
I have to put it in the box.

9
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,292
And that is what
separates the U.S. Postal Service

10
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,835
from those hippies at FedEx.

11
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,588
Oh, goody.

12
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,751
What is so exciting?

13
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,756
It's a letter from Doctor Wolcott.

14
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,463
We've been corresponding
about my string theory research.

15
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:50,597
Wait, Robert Wolcott?
Like Wolcott's Theorem, Wolcott?

16
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,014
The very same.

17
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,139
RAJ: Didn't he go crazy
and cut off all contact with people?

18
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,020
HOWARD: Yeah, he was driven mad
by a friend

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,819
who kept wanting to
talk about the Hulk's car insurance.

20
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,574
Oh, he's invited me
to his cabin for the weekend

21
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,151
To discuss a breakthrough he's had.

22
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,735
HOWARD: His cabin?

23
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,117
Yes, he lives off the grid
up in the mountains.

24
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,615
So, you're gonna
go to the middle of nowhere

25
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,997
and spend the weekend
with a crazy man you've never met?

26
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,252
Yes, why?

27
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,456
No reason, have fun.

28
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,960
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

29
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,528
SHELDON: Hmm.

30
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,073
Oh.

31
00:01:58,577 --> 00:01:59,624
Hmm.

32
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:03,461
(LAUGHING) Nice one.

33
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,090
Hey, Penny, that's what you sound like
when you read.

34
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,097
- Hey.
- What, he said it.

35
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,808
Sheldon, what are you doing?

36
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:17,772
I'm decoding Doctor Wolcott's letter
using this book as the key.

37
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,940
Aren't conversations more fun
when they're in code?

38
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,357
Yes, but I'm using a code
where "yes" means "no."

39
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,865
Oh, I got it.
He's given me directions to his cabin.

40
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,316
Seems a little paranoid.

41
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,027
Wha- He is not paranoid.
(CLEARING THROAT)

42
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,945
What are you doing?

43
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,201
Following his instructions.

44
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,965
Leonard, you are not letting
Sheldon go alone this weekend.

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,419
Well, I am a grown man,
I don't need somebody to chaperone me.

46
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,346
I just need him to drop me off,
pick me up and pack me a sack lunch.

47
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,307
Don't look at me.

48
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,181
When the music stopped,
you were holding Sheldon.

49
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,188
Amy can't take him, it's her
bachelorette party this weekend.

50
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,016
Yes, it is! Because I'm getting married!

51
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,561
Are you gonna be doing that all weekend?

52
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,645
Yes, do you know why?

53
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,729
Because you're getting married!
(WHOOPING)

54
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:08,814
(WHOOPING)

55
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,734
All right, Leonard,
looks like you're driving me.

56
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,819
But maybe you could drop me
at the bottom of the mountain,

57
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,154
I want him to think I'm cool.

58
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,741
HOWARD: That's great,
everyone's got weekend plans.

59
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,076
Amy has her bachelorette party

60
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,126
and Sheldon's gonna go to the woods
and get hunted for sport.

61
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,419
Yeah, as someone who has to track him
every time he gets lost in IKEA,

62
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:27,715
I fee I like I'd be really good at that.

63
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,464
Leonard, you cannot drop him off,

64
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,467
you have to stay with him
and keep him safe.

65
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,389
Howard, you have to go
and keep Leonard safe.

66
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,091
- Fine.
-l get it.

67
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,347
And you want me to go
and keep Howard safe.

68
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,679
- Actually, I-
- Just say yes

69
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,434
or he's gonna want to
come to the bachelorette party.

70
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,648
Are you sure
you're going to be okay this weekend?

71
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,823
Of course.
I'm much more concerned about you.

72
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,446
I know how you gals behave
when the men are away.

73
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,118
You do?

74
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,947
I've read the Bacchae by Euripides.

75
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,499
Drinking wine, riding panthers...

76
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,038
Proof that girls have gone wild
for over 2500 years.

77
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,504
Well, I wish I could say
none of that is gonna happen,

78
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,926
but Penny is planning it,

79
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,380
and she is the reason I own those
underwear with writing across the butt.

80
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:20,182
Well, just be careful
and use protection.

81
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,396
What do you think is gonna happen?

82
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,817
I don't know, but it's going to be sunny
and you burn easily.

83
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,937
It'll be fine.

84
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,318
I'm sure there'll be some drinking
and some dancing

85
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,401
and then a mailman will probably show up
and take his clothes off.

86
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,703
Nicholas is going to
take his clothes off?

87
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:43,660
No, not our mailman.
A dancer pretending to be a mailman.

88
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:47,087
Impersonating a federal employee,
oh, where's the after party, prison?

89
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,422
It's sweet that you're worried about me.

90
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,220
Well, of course I'm worried about you.
I want you to be safe.

91
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,592
And I want you to be safe.

92
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,140
I will be. I'll have my friends with me.

93
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,765
If anything should go wrong
I can use them as human shields.

94
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,891
LECTURER ON RECORDING:
For most of human history,

95
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:12,070
<i>time was believed to be
an objective part of reality.</i>

96
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,945
<i>But with the contributions
of immanuel Kant,</i>

97

<i>science and philosophy charted-</i>

98
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,531
When I said you should make a playlist
for the road trip, I meant music.

99
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:28,462
This is better than music.
This is a lecture on non-linear time.

100
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,335
Sounds like it's just on regular time.

101
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,290
Yes, but I put it on shuffle.

102
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,178
This is nice.

103
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,131
The four of us
haven't taken a trip like this

104
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,887
since Leonard's bachelor party.

105
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,764
And now here we are for Sheldon's.

(STAMMERING) Leonard...

107
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,642
As Sheldon's best man,

108
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,270
I need to inform you
that this is not a bachelor party.

109
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,524
And tell them why.

110
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,068
Because you're a tiresome scold.

111
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,776
No. It's because a bachelor party is
typically a hedonistic blow-out

112
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,577
where no pleasures
of the flesh are denied.

113
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:01,904
I'm not interested in that.

114
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,873
How is that not exactly what I said?

115
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:12,669
Okay, now, I promised Sheldon things
weren't gonna get too crazy tonight.

116
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,873
Should I be worried?

117
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,130
Just about who you're marrying.

and sex toys we thought,

"What does Amy like?"

127
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,585
Amy likes a quilting bee.

Oh, these are my friends.
I wrote about them in my letter.

Well, um, I don't normally
allow strangers into my house.

149
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,570
But when you do,
you let them out, right?

150
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,619
Doctor Cooper, if you can promise me

these men share

yeah, I suppose they can join us.

153

You guys might need to wait in the car.

Well, let me show you around.

who have wronged me, I do over there.

158
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,146
I've always said that
I should get a grudge chair.

159
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,602
Leonard, have I not always said that?

160
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,738
You have, but you were worried
you'd spend too much time in it.

161
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,737
Well... That is a real concern.

162
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:51,165
Oh, my God, this tomato is amazing!
I can eat it like an apple.

163
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,369
My secret is I fertilize it
with my own manure.

164
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,387
The look on your face. (GIGGLING)

165
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,847
It's a sort of grin,
you wanna know what kind?

166
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,687
So, Doctor Wolcott,

167
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,437
in your letter you said you had
a new mathematical approach

168
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,439
that would help me conceptualize
the dimensions in string theory.

169
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,815
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes.

170
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,364
But, before we get started,

171
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,158
lam going to need
to collect everybody's phones.

172
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,530
- Oh.
- LEONARD: Why?

173
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,951
Because they are
little listening devices, aren't they?

174
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,751
Yes, for people to spy on you
and steal your work.

175
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,373
Yeah, what happened to the good old days

176
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,795
where if someone
wanted to steal your work

177
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,214
they had to hire a prostitute
to seduce you?

178
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,626
Who told you about that?

179
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,841
Just making a joke.

180
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,798
Yeah, it's not funny when it happens.

181
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:57,060
All right, now, you're probably going to
want to start with this notebook here.

182
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,598
- Oh.
- Here we are.

183
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,809
Oh, my. on. (CHUCKLING)

184
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:06,277
Um, no offense, Doctor Wolcott,
but I'm not sure this makes any sense.

185
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,324
That's because
I've written it all backwards.

186
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,072
You- Wow.

187
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,280
That's "wow" backwards.

188
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,201
You... Um, I still don't get it.

189
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,878
Well, plus, the numbers are letters
and letters are numbers.

190
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:21,955
(INHALING) Oh.

191
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,581
I love him.

192
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,729
Are you having fun?

193
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:43,769
Yeah, ljust, uh,
finished sewing this top-to-bottom,

194
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,526
and now
I'm going to sew it side-to-side.

195
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,609
- Pace yourself.
-(BOTH CHUCKLING)

196
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,993
- Some more tea?
- Oh, lovely.

197
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,410
Oh!

198
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,208
Seriously? What the hell?

199
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,540
- Huh?
- What?

200
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,718
This is my bachelorette party,
tea and quilts?

201
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,216
Well, you said
you didn't want anything crazy.

202
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,765
Yes, but I said it like,
"I don't want anything crazy,"

203
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,263
which clearly means
I wanted something crazy.

204
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,808
I mean,
is this how boring you think I am?

205
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,266
Penny, she asked you a question.

206
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,103
Of course not.

207
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,813
So, you thought that
I would like quilting?

208
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,068
Well, don't you?

209
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,821
Of course, I like quilting,
it's the slowest way to make a blanket.

210
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,453
But this is my bachelorette party.

211
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,998
It's supposed to be fun and wild
and full of bad decisions.

212
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,871
Hey, we can make bad decisions.

213
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,999
Yeah, she had two kids back-to-back
and I thought you'd like this,

214
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,295
so we're off to a good start.

215
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,419
Come on, let's go somewhere we can do
body shots off shirtless bartenders.

216
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,502
Yes.

217
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,929
Oh, I don't know,
that might be too much.

218
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,006
All right, you know what, why don't
we stay home and have a little wine-

219
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,762
What are you not getting about this?

220
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,891
Doctor Wolcott,
your work on time is revolutionary.

221
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,396
I would say thank you,
but in my theory of time

222
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,399
you've already
called my work revolutionary,

223
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,570
I've already thanked you,

224
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,240
and I hate repeating myself,
so let's move on.

225
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,327
Wait a minute. Are you saying

226
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,746
that time has multiple dimensions,
the same as space?

227
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,121
No, no. I'm not saying it,
the math is saying it.

228
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,045
Though, it is the math that I invented,
so, yes, I guess I am saying it.

229
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,874
You understanding any of this?

230
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,215
I haven't understood anything
since poop-tomato.

231
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,720
My goodness, this is incredible.

232
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,053
See, I... I'm just not seeing
where string theory fits into all this

233
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,479
and that's where I think that you and I
could be of help to each other.

234
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,106
Thank you, I'd be honored.

235
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,650
All right. Allow me to
show you my most recent journal.

236
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,157
Sheldon's right,
this guy... This guy's brilliant.

237
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,444
Yeah, I mean, he's a little kooky,

238
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,621
but a mind that can reconceptualize time

239
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,790
probably has a reason
for keeping a jar of toenail clippings

240
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,207
that we just don't understand.

241
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,412
I could spend months up here
just going through his math.

242
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,917
You know, I think Sheldon might.

243
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,125
Great, who's gonna tell Amy

244
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,051
we lost her fiancé
to a mad man in the mountains?

245
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:16,929
Hey, I drove.

246
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,845
This is so exciting.
Can we do a body shot?

247
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,772
I've always wanted to do a body shot.
Also, what's a body shot?

248
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,606
It's when you take a drink
out of a stranger's belly button.

249
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,278
Oh, no thanks.

250
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,981
What if they have an outie?
Does it just spill everywhere?

251
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,201
Okay, look, we've got all night.
Let's just take it easy-

252
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,369
I'm getting married!

253
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,662
(CHEERING)

254
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,121
Here you go, first round's on the house.

255
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,748
- Ooh.
- Hey, there. Do you do body shots?

256
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,204
Oh. She said she didn't want one-

257
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:50,288
Mind your business.

258
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,541
Cheers! (WHOOPING)

259
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,390
Amy? Amy? Should we get her home?

260
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,386
Why? She's sound asleep
and we have sliders coming.

261
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,353
One more round.

262
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,818
So, how would this work
in the context of a singularity?

263
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,820
Yes, that's a tricky bit to explain.

264
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,194
I assume you're familiar
with non-abelian group theory.

265
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,573
Oh, and how! You never
forget your first group theory.

266
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,995
Listen, I'm going to put
on a pot of coffee,

267
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,948
because there's a
lot of math to go through.

268
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,121
And he said he didn't
want a wild bachelor party.

269
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,618
Excuse me?

270
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,954
Oh, Sheldon is getting married
in a month.

271
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:35,588
Oh, congratulations.
Yeah, I'm a married man myself.

272
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,210
Oh, really? ls she here?

273
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,294
And alive?

274
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,015
And... And can people
other than you see her?

275
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,766
She lives in Munich.
It's a perfect marriage.

276
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:52,442
We focus on our work and send each other
cards every year on our birthdays.

277
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,436
Wait, what... What month is it?

278
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,146
- Uh, April.
- Most years.

279
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,403
The point is we give each other space.

280
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,826
I give her Europe,
she gives me South America,

281
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,529
that's where she thinks I'm living.

282
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,455
Oh, I... I've never considered
a long distance marriage.

283
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,457
Well, listen,
if you want to be a great scientist

284
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,004
you can't afford to be distracted.

285
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,460
Hey, where are my manners?
You fellows must be hungry.

286
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,760
- Do you like rabbit?
- Yeah. Sure.

287
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,634
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

288
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:26,309
But can you tell the
difference between rabbit and squirrel?

289
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,681
- No. Don't think so.
- Probably not.

290
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,560
Great, we're having rabbit.

291
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,560
Be right back.

292
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,404
It's amazing how much he's accomplished

293
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,577
by isolating himself from
the distractions of day-to-day life.

294
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,405
Okay, please don't tell me
you wanna live like this.

295
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,287
See, that's the strange thing, I don't.

296
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:55,376
What is wrong with me?
Why don't I want this?

297
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,128
Look how cool it all is.

298
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,459
Nothing is wrong with you.

299
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:03,217
You have friends, you have a fiancée.
You have a full life.

300
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,971
You know what? You're right.

301
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,475
Thank you for bringing me up here.

302
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,728
But I think I'm ready to go home now.

303
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,901
Really? You don't want to stay
for dinner and talk more science?

304
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:22,232
No, no, we better go. I miss Amy.
And my phone.

305
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,953
(GUN FIRING)

306
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,948
Also, I'm from Texas

307
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,409
and I can taste the difference
between rabbit and squirrel.

308
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,872
(TV PLAYING MUSIC)

309
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,715
Whoa... Huh?

310
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,633
- Oh, look who's back.
- There she is.

311
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,214
What happened? How did we get here?

312
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,720
You don't remember anything?

313
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,020
I remember taking some shots
and then... That's it.

314
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,898
Oh, my gosh, did I pass out?

315
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,476
You kinda did.

316
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,357
At my own bachelorette party?
I'm so lame.

317
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,199
Oh, you didn't pass out
before you did all kinds of fun stuff.

318
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,442
What did I do?

319
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,700
(INCREDULOUSLY) What did you do?

320
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,406
(IN NORMAL VOICE) What did she do?

321
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,621
Um, well, you don't remember
Riverdancing on top of the bar?

322
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,136
- I did that?
- Yeah, you did.

323
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,212
Mmm.

324
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,681
But I don't know how to Riverdance.

325
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,639
Didn't stop you from
teaching all those shirtless firemen.

326
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,102
I saw shirtless firemen?

327
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,600
Saw, smelled, slid down like a pole.

328
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,612
Did I flash anybody?

329
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,690
How about "everybody"?

330
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:52,493
I can't believe it, I'm so embarrassed.
You didn't take any pictures, did you?

331
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,994
Oh, no, we would never do that to you.

332
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,498
Yeah, but if there were pictures,
they would be (SINGSONG) crazy.

333
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,876
- You guys are good friends.
- PENNY: Mmm.

334
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,418
(IRISH FIDDLE MUSIC PLAYING)

335
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,432
Dinner!

336
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,060
Guys?

337
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,062
I can't believe they left
without saying goodbye.

338
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,823
Wait a minute,
what if they stole my work?

339
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,744
Wait a minute,
what if they were never here at all?

340
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,655
Wait a minute,

341
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:38,209
what if they haven't gotten here yet
but they're on their way?

342
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,912
I'd better tidy up.

343
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:52,973
Hello.

344
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,017
Welcome back. How did it go?

345
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,263
Doctor Wolcott's theories of time

346
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,270
might save
my new interpretation of string theory.

347
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,813
Well, that's exciting.

348
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:06,362
Yeah, it is.
How was your bachelorette party?

349
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:11,283
Well, I was in a bar
and I saw some shirtless men.

350
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,244
They were firemen
and they fought over me.

351
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,282
But, Penny and Bernadette
got me out of there

352
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,209
before the victor got my spoils.

353
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,330
I see.

354
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,708
What's the matter? You look glum.

355
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:33,886
Amy, would you still love me
if I wasn't who you thought I was?

356
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:35,929
What are you talking about?

357
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:41,015
Well, what if it turns out
I'm not the single-minded,

358
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,940
science-obsessed recluse

359
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,359
who puts his work
above everything and everybody else

360
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,686
that you fell in love with?

361
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,151
What if I'm not the straight-laced,

362
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,282
buttoned-up,
quilting queen you thought I was?

363
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,367
What if I'm a Riverdancing wild woman?

364
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,375
I'd still love you.

365
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,302
I'd still love you, too.

366
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,593
Do you really know how to Riverdance?

367
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,056
You tell me.

368
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,287
I'm the only man you do that for.

369
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,246
