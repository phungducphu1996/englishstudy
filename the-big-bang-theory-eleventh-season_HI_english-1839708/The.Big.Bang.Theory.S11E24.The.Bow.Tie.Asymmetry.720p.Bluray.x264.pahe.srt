1
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:05,430
All right, Saturday is the big day.

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:07,349
A lot of people thought
this would never come.

3
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,309
I may have been one of those people.

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,766
I may have been one of those people.

5
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,644
- Wait, are we talking about the wedding?
- Yes.

6
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,103
Yeah, I was definitely
one of those people.

7
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,482
And yet, here we are. Now, we got
a lot of family coming in tomorrow.

8
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,858
I'm gonna need everyone's help.

9
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,323
Think of this as
one of your comic book movies.

10
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,651
There's a bunch of superheroes,
each with a different task.

11
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,069
Like the new Avengers.

12
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,580
- Which one was that?
- The one you slept through last weekend.

13
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,123
That was a good nap.

14
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:36,963
Well, I think it's more like
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> ,

15
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,501
and you're the Fellowship.

16
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,668
Someone's got to go to Gondor,
someone's got to go to Mordor,

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,253
someone's got to hold off
the demon of shadow and flame.

18
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,421
- You mean the Balrog?
-l mean, my mother.

19
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,718
- That is a perfect metaphor, Amy.
- Thank you.

20
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:54,681
Because it also involves a ring
that binds me in servitude forever.

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,732
He said "forever".

22
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,769
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

23
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:28,514
That was Wil Wheaton.
He's really excited about tomorrow.

24
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:29,844
As am I.

25
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,975
If you'd have told me as a child,

26
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:35,725
that an actor from Star Trek
would be officiating my wedding,

27
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,764
I would've said, "Ooh! William Shatner?"

28
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,269
And if you'd have said,
"No, Wil Wheaton," I'd have said,

29
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,067
"Well, did you even
try William Shatner?"

30
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,024
And if you'd have said,
"Yes, but he costs too much money,"

31
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,109
I'd have said,
"Well, Wil Wheaton's good, too. "

32
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,663
Why do you keep
tying and untying that bow tie?

33
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,448
I can't seem to get it even.

34
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:58,752
I don't think it's supposed to be even.
Sometimes a little asymmetry looks good.

35
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,209
In the Renaissance,
they called it "sprezzatura."

36
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,748
The Renaissance?

37
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,884
Amy, you know I'm more of
an Enlightenment person.

38
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,221
At some point, we have to decide
how we want to raise the children.

39
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:15,098
So, are you feeling okay?
No wedding jitters?

40
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:16,595
No.

41
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,472
There is nothing in the world

42
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,557
that would stop me
from marrying you tomorrow,

43
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,274
even me from the future
coming back to prevent the wedding

44
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,318
and the subsequent birth of a child
who will destroy humanity.

45
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,905
Because if you came from the future,

46
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,986
that would mean you already went through
with the wedding

47
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,619
because you believe that
time travel is on a closed loop.

48
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,125
I love you so damn much.

I'm surprised Amy didn't pick us up.

53
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:55,138
Oh. Well, you know, she's pretty busy
the day before her wedding.

54
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:00,856
Too busy for her mother?
She used to be such a devoted daughter.

55

Now, she's just waiting for me to die,

Mom.

Oh, so, now, it's racist to notice
when somebody's Indian?

I don't think it's racist.
I noticed you were both white.

See? You have to excuse her.
She's just pregnant and hormonal.

Amelia Earhart in the eighth grade?

Welcome, Bert. Don't you look nice.

157
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,664
Yeah. Like a geode, I clean up good.

158
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,955
Don't you crack a geode open?

159
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,870
It's not a perfect metaphor.

160
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,633
Oh, my God. ls that Mark Hamill?

161
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,709
Yeah.

162

- Oh, my God. ls that-
-(SHOUTS) Bert, go find your seat!

163
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,515
What is he doing here?

164
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,094
I found his dog and guilted him
into officiating the wedding.

165
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,520
Don't tell Sheldon. It's a surprise.

166
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,563
Wait, I thought
Wil was officiating the wedding.

167
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,855
Yeah, so did he.

168
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,269
- How did he take the news?
-I'll let you know.

169
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,568
Hey. Wil!

(SNIFFLES)

171
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,865
Are you having an allergic reaction
to my boutonniere?

172
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,323
No. I'm just so happy for you.

173
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,533
And for me.

174
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,702
After today, you are officially,

175
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,505
and more important,
legally, Amy's problem.

176
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:46,803
Don't be silly, Leonard.
I will always be your problem.

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

178
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,228
Hey, baby.

179
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,430
Hello, Mother.

180
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,182
Leonard, could you give us a moment?

181
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,396
Of course.

182
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,817
Oh, Shelly...

183
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,784
I wish your dad could see you now.

184
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,700
Me, too. I miss him.

185
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,121
He would be so proud of you.
I know that I am.

186
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,035
Thank you.

187
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,170
I mean, for everything. My whole life.

188
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,669
(CRYING)

189
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,262
(LAUGHING SOFTLY)

190
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:32,265
Let me straighten your tie.

191
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,637
No, it's all right.

192
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,766
It's supposed to be
a little asymmetrical.

193
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,516
Apparently, a small flaw
somehow improves it.

194
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,645
I can see that.

195
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,485
Sometimes, it's the imperfect stuff

196
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,733
that makes things perfect.

197
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:54,950
Excuse me.

198
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,953
Case in point.

199
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,841
So, we finally meet.

200
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,010
I'm sorry, who are you?

201
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,506
I'm Wil Wheaton.

202
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,717
I was supposed to
officiate this wedding.

203
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,178
I was up all night,
preparing these notes.

204
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,598
Well, thanks so much.
It's gonna be a great help.

205
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,397
-(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
- SHELDON: Amy. Amy.

206
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,737
- Amy.
- Come in.

207
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,035
(PANTING) There's
something I need to tell you.

208
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,367
Wow, you look amazing!

209
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,416
That's not what I need to tell you.
But you do.

210
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,790
- What's wrong?
- Something incredible just happened.

211
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,963
Remember when you were telling me
about my bow tie,

212
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,587
-and how a little asymmetry is good?
- Yeah?

213
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,465
My equations have been trying
to describe an imperfect world,

214
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,800
and the only way to do that

215
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,803
is to introduce imperfection
into the underlying theory.

216
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:01,601
So, instead of supersymmetry,
it would be super asymmetry?

217
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,978
(GASPS) Super asymmetry. That's it!

218
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,361
- Give me your lipstick.
- What?

219
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,313
(SHOUTING) Just give it to me,
you beautiful thing! We have work to do!

220
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:17,620
Hey, the bride and groom
seem to be running a little behind.

221
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,080
Do you think you could stall?

222
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,622
Stall? How?

223
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,585
Hey, everybody!

224
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,749
It's gonna be a few more minutes,
but while we wait,

225
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,752
does anyone have
any questions about Star Wars?

226
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,382
You got this.

227
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,438
So, if I make slightly asymmetric knots
with sheets in four dimensions,

228
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:48,940
I can bootstrap the whole idea to
a large asymmetry in 11 dimensions.

229
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,605
Well, maybe even at
the initial moment of creation,

230
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,406
the fundamental forces lacked symmetry.

231
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:54,987
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

232
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,736
Everyone's waiting.
What are you guys doing?

233
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,119
Super asymmetry.

234
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,447
Super asymmetry? ls that a thing?

235
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,036
We're inventing it right now.

236
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,661
Don't you think this can wait until...

237
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,330
Hold on. This is interesting.

238
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,793
So, yeah, Mr. Mark?

239
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,930
When you were on
the Wookiee home planet,

240
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,469
how did you even understand
what they were saying?

241
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,727
I don't remember ever being
on a Wookiee home planet.

242
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,607
Actually, Luke was on
the Wookiee home planet, Kashyyyk,

243
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:31,027
in the Holiday Special, when
he helped Chewie get home to his wife.

244
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:34,610
Chewie had a wife?

245
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,400
Her name's Malla.

246
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,569
Wow, that's impressive.

247
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,029
Yeah.

248
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,160
Hey, I got a question.

249
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,873
Why aren't there tires
on any of those Star Wars vehicles?

250
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,544
I'm sure some of them had tires.

251
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:53,833
Actually, they don't.

252
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,760
I mean, the HAVw A5 Turbo Tank
has metal-gripping wheels,

253
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,260
but I wouldn't call them tires.

254
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,511
You are so hot.

255
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:15,064
This is taking too long.
I bet that Sheldon stood my baby up.

256
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,819
Excuse me. Where are you going?

257
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,239
This whole thing was a big mistake.

258
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,070
I'm gonna find Amy
and get her out of here.

00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,790
Excuse me?

261
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,085
Sheldon loves Amy,

262
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,788
and he would never hurt her
on her wedding day, or any other day,

263
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,872
so, park it.

264
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,005
Oh, you sit down, too.

265
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:47,183
Are you gonna let her
talk to me like that? Say something.

266
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,431
Thank you.

267
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,068
According to Google, there are zero
papers that mention super asymmetry.

268
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,114
This is brand-new.
No one's thought of it.

269
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,318
What are you lunatics doing?

270
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:04,871
Sheldon had a breakthrough.

271
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,115
Actually, Amy and I had a breakthrough.

272
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,121
Science? Shocking.

273
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,453
You don't understand.
This could be really big.

274
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:13,789
No, Penny's right.

275
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,671
We have our whole lives
to do science together.

276
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,720
Let's get married.

277
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,099
All right. It's go time. I am pumped!

278
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,433
Okay, everyone. Here we go.

He heard you, and He can't un-hear you.

297
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,854
We're here to celebrate the marriage

298
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:05,320
of Sheldon Lee Cooper
and Amy Farrah Fowler.

299
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:06,984
I had more prepared,

300
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,446
but I'm just gonna skip
to the rings and vows,

301
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,157
since I've been answering your questions
for 45 minutes.

302
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,830
Yeah, he answered 'em.

303
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,001
Amy, you're up.

304
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,431
Sheldon, when I was a little girl,

305
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,727
I used to dream about my wedding,
but eventually, I stopped,

306
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:36,098
because I thought
that day would never come.

307
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,265
And then I met you.

308
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,311
From the first moment
in that coffee shop,

309
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,272
I knew that there was
something special between us,

310
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,409
even though I did work on a study
that disproved love at first sight.

311
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,538
I loved that study the moment I read it.

312
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,581
Ironic, huh?

313
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,415
Clearly, it was wrong.

314
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,165
Because I felt something that day,

315
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,051
and those feelings
have only gotten stronger with time.

316
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,682
I can't imagine loving you
more than I do right now.

317
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:16,346
But I felt that way yesterday,
and the day before yesterday,

318
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,515
and the day before that.

319
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,356
Is that growth linear, or accelerating?

320
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,479
Accelerating.

321
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,026
Oh, maybe we could graph it out.

322
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,487
Save something for the honeymoon.

323
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,032
Smart.

324
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,494
Sheldon,

325
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,375
I don't know what the future holds,

326
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:44,462
but I know that I've never been happier
than I am in this moment, marrying you.

327
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,087
Well, that was
unexpectedly beautiful. (CRYING)

328
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:54,763
(SHAKILY) I might need a minute.

329
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,559
Amy.

330
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,066
I usually know exactly what to say.

331
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,743
But, in this moment,

332
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,414
I have no words.

333
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,790
I guess, (EXHALES)

334
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,840
I'm overwhelmed by you.

335
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,002
In a good way.

336
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,972
Not in the elevator
in the Haunted Mansion way.

337
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:39,972
Even if I can't tell you now,
how I feel,

338
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:45,481
I will spend my life
showing you how much I love you.

339
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,198
(VOICE SHAKING) Do you...

340
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,361
<i>(CLEARS THROAT)</i>

341
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,113
(VOICE SHAKING) Do you...

342
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:02,377
Hey, I'm just sayin', I'm here,
if you need me to step in.

343
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,671
No, no, no. I got this.

344
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:13,296
Amy, do you take Sheldon
for your lawful wedded husband?

345
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,713
I do.

346
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,636
(VOICE CHOKING)
And, Sheldon, same thing.

347
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,471
I do.

348
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,308
Then by the power vested in me,

349
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,520
by even-you-can-perform-weddings-dot-com

350
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,194
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

351
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,200
You may kiss the bride.

352
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,793
(AT LAST PLAYING)

353
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,841
