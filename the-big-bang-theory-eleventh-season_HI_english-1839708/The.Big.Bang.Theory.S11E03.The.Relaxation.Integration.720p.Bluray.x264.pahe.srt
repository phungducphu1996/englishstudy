00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:05,009
Hmm, some news of our wedding.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,679
I have sent you all
a save the date email.

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,468
Oh, exciting. You guys picked a date?

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,645
Better, I picked eighty dates.

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,852
And I need you to save them all
until we narrow it down.

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,400
I thought we agreed on June 15th.

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,478
That's the day after Flag Day.

8
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,275
Everybody will be partied out.

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,692
It's a date, just pick one.

10
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:28,029
It's not just a date,
it's a textbook optimization problem.

11
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,405
There is a perfect date,

12
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,245
just like there's a perfect
room temperature and a perfect dessert.

13
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,243
Hmm. There's no perfect dessert.

14
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,954
Yellow cake in the shape of a dinosaur
with chocolate frosting,

15
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,210
scoop of vanilla ice cream
on the side, not touching.

16
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,509
You'll see,
you'll have it at our wedding.

17
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,254
You wanna bet?

18
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,721
You give me enough time, I can do
the same thing with the wedding date.

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,895
It needs to be on the weekend,
not near any of your birthdays

20
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,267
or the weekend of Comic-Con.

21
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,814
Oh, you can get married at Comic-Con.

22
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,890
"No!
"No!

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,820
We just need a weekend date
that's completely boring and uneventful.

24
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,731
Too bad you didn't get
your ducks in a row

25
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,191
'cause tonight would've been perfect.

26

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

27
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:38,724
Good morning.

28
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,517
Good morning.

29
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,778
I know today is Apple Jack's clay,
but we're all out.

30
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,566
That's fine. I'll have anything.

31
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,276
- Really?
- Yeah.

32
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,574
You know, whatev.

33
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,367
"Whatev?" I like this side of you.

34
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,501
You know what I like?

35
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,378

Hey, just a reminder,
I'm goin' out for drinks after work.

38
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,491
Great. Just a reminder, you're pregnant.

39
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,579
I'm not drinking,
just taking a new co-worker out.

40
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,407
(CHUCKLES) Just a reminder,
you're married.

41
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,580
Female co-worker.

42
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,995
She's new in town
and I wanna make her feel welcome.

43
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,377
And let her know
the office is full of liars

44
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,833
before everyone tells her I'm mean.

45
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,835
Is she single?

46
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,050
I'm not setting her up with Raj.

47
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,297
What about Stuart?

48
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,759
Are you listening?
I want her to think I'm not mean.

49
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,312
Okay. Well, it's just,
we have two single friends.

50
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,316
Howie, I just met this woman.

51
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,275
Why don't I wait a little
and get to know her.

52
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,027
Maybe I won't like her

53
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,397
and then I'd be happy
to ruin her life with Stuart or Raj.

54
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,525
That's all I ask.

55
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,989
So you guys lived with Sheldon
for a long time.

56
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,037
- Long time.
- So very long.

57
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,995
By the way, congratulations again
on your engagement.

58
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,004
Yeah, you got a good one.

59
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,250
Thanks. So it's strange,

60
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,218
Sheldon was talking
in his sleep last night

61
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,846
and he seemed like
a totally different person.

62
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,676
He was relaxed and loose and calm.

63
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,851
Sheldon's a complicated man.

64
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,394
He said "whatev."

65
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,560
Get him a brain scan,
that might be a tumor.

66
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,277
Well, I think the wedding planning
is really stressful for him

67
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,025
and that can trigger sleep talking.

68
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,486
Maybe this is a part of Sheldon's
personality he's been repressing.

69
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,535
Yeah, I think we dream about things
we wish we could be in real life.

70
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,491
Really? What do you dream about?

71
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,118
Oh, uh...

72
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,958
Being the wife of Leonard, mostly that.

74
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,495
I choose to believe you.

75
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,582
Well, as much as we've
studied the brain,

76
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,918
there's still a lot we don't know
about dreams and their function.

77
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,844
You know, even psychologists
are divided on it.

78
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,589
Mm, it's true. Freud thought dreams
were about sex.

79
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,011
Adler thought they were about dominance.

80
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,185
Then again mine are just about
being married to this little guy.

81
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,314
Okay, now it's just edging into mockery.

82
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,903
Well, moving to a new city
was a little scary,

83
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,484
but the job seems great.
Everyone's really nice.

84
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,365
Oh, they are, super nice.

85
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,573
I mean, only one of them
took you out tonight,

86
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,745
but it's not a competition.

87
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,913
Thanks again.

88
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,875
You know, we could've gone somewhere
more pregnancy friendly.

89
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,045
Oh, it's okay. One of the great things
about being pregnant

90
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,963
is drinking cranberryjuice
out of a wine glass

We would've had a lovely wedding

and our honeymoon would have coincided

with the first appearance
of the Hale-Bopp comet.

Sheldon, you were 16.

And in Texas,
no one would have batted an eye.

to make this wedding perfect,

159
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,108
that you no longer live off your parents
like a spoiled child.

160
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,657
You live over someone's garage,
like a failed adult.

161
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,778
Yeah, well, you live with her.

162
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:10,081
Oh, it's not like that. He rents a room
from me and my husband,

163
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,041
who, by the way is no prize either.

164
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,415
Oh, I don't care.

165
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,335
You know me, I just go with the flow.

166
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,715
Beach, public pool,

167
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,092
they both sound awesome.

168
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,726
SHELDON: (ON SPEAKERS)
On second thought, beach,

169
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,062
<i>I'd like to befriend a seagull.</i>

170
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,185
That is crazy.

171
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,113
Yeah. Will you email that to me?

172
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,075
Have you played this for him?

173
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,986
No, I'm worried he'll say
I violated his privacy.

174
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,072
Listen, how happy he sounds.

175
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:51,949
<i>SHELDON". I'm up for anything.</i>

176
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,326
<i>As long as I'm with you.</i>

177
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,666
What're you listening to?

178
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:58,747
Nothing.

179
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,207
Oh, come on, I wanna hear.

180
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,593
SHELDON: We don't need GPS,

181
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,555
<i>let's just see where the road takes us.</i>

182
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,759
I see why you turned it off,

183
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,059
that guy sounds like an idiot.

184
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,895
Honey, that's you.

185
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,229
Don't be silly.
My voice is deep and sonorous,

186
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,685
like a Caucasian James Earl Jones.

187
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:24,652
"Luke, I'm your father." See.

188
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,944
It is you. I recorded you in your sleep.

189
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,997
<i>SHELDON: Oh, look, a hitchhiker,</i>

190
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,200
<i>I bet he has some interesting stories.</i>

191
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,086
- That's me?
- It's you.

192
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,957
So you spied on me in my sleep?

193
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,584
Sheldon, I'm sorry,

194
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,210
you've been doing this every night.

195
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,128
I couldn't help but wonder
if it meant something.

196
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,339
- Well, it doesn't.
- Are you sure?

197
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,767
I mean, the prefrontal cortex
regulates impulse control,

198
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,886
so its plausible that when we're asleep,

199
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,015
aspects of our personality
that we repress might come out.

200
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,939
Don't try to put science lipstick
on your New Age pig.

201
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,317
And for the record,
you make noises when you sleep

202
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,032
and I've never accused you
of repressing your inner chainsaw.

203
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,830
If you want me to
object at your wedding,

204
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,122
just give me one of these.

205
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,593
This picture of Galactus eating a planet
looks like my preggo wife

206
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,924
destroying a coffee cake.

207
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,799
Oh, yeah, I see it.

208
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,186
I'm just saying, you should bow out.

209
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,604
Why should I bow out?

210
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,810
Because we all know
how this is gonna end.

211
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,109
That's what my doctor said, too,
but I'm still here.

212
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,366
Okay, look, I think that
she and I have more in common.

213
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,408
Because you're Indian?

214
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,737
So just 'cause she's brown,
you get to date her.

215
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,572
Yes.

216
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,831
And the next time we meet a woman who's
pale and cadaver-like, she's all yours.

217
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:01,703
(SIGHS)

218
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,168
Howard, Bernadette was there last night,

219
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,840
did she say anything when she got home?

220
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,716
Yeah, she said, "Why'd you tell
those idiots where I was? Thanks a lot."

221
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,009
Okay, how about we flip a coin?

222
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,259
Hang on, doesn't this girl
get a word in all of this

223
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,968
and isn't that word "no"?

224
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,471
Ruchi said she wanted to hang out
with both of us,

225
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,727
why don't we just do that?

226
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,022
Oh, fine. Let's hang out as friends
and see what happens.

227
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,737
Yeah, and if something grows out of it,
just worry about it then.

228
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,439
Also what my doctor said.

229
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,325
Hey, this isn't your laundry night.

230
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,782
(SIGHS) I know, laundry on a Wednesday.

231
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,829
Some madness my life has become.

232
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,626
Why is this sleep talking thing
bothering you anyway?

233
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:46,873
It's simple.

234
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,674
I don't like the idea that my mind

235
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,839
might be keeping
an entire personality from me.

236
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,759
Doctor Jekyll's other personality
was Mr. Hyde.

237
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,600
Mr. Hyde didn't have
a postgraduate degree.

238
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,437
Is it possible that you're stressed

239
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,435
because you're scared
about getting married?

240
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,110
I mean, it is a big change
and you're not good with little changes.

241
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,354
That's nonsense.

242
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,777
You name one little change
I was upset with.

243
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,447
Uh, when they changed
the green Skittle from lime to apple.

244
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,575
That is not the rainbow
I grew up tasting.

245
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,456
(SIGHS)

246
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,995
All right, fine. Let's start over.

247
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,618
Is it possible

248
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,669
that the sleep talking is a part
of your brain that's telling you

249
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,669
everything's gonna be okay
and you just need to relax a little?

250
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,926
So, you're proposing that

251
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,715
the self is an illusion.

252
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,302
And that we actually have
multiple centers of consciousness

253
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,180
that are communicating with one another?

254
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,562
In layman's terms, yeah.

255
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,683
Huh! Interesting.

256
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,735
So you don't believe
there is a Cartesian self

257
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,813
that underlies the flux of experience.

258
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,573
Maybe in my twenties, not anymore.

259
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,409
Okay.

260
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,578
Well assuming you're right,

261
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,490
what would you suggest I do?

262
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,578
Well, I would start
with something small.

263
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,042
See if it makes your life any better.

264
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,962
Uh, you could learn to meditate,
take a yoga class.

265
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,550
You know, I have always
been intrigued by flip-flops,

266
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,971
the official footwear
of the laid back fellow.

267
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,598
Okay. Sure.

268
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,267
Of course if my feet
are gonna be exposed

269
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,594
I'll need to update my tetanus booster.

270
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,604
Oh, yeah. Makes sense.

271
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,398
And while I'm there, I might as well
get a flu shot and a mole check.

272
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,520
Sure. (SIGHS)

273
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,693
You know, I've never had a mole check.

274
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,229
Oh.

275
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,192
Well, it's been nice knowing you.

276
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,161
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

277
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,747
It's too bad Stuart couldn't make it.
He seemed fun.

278
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,542
Oh, yeah. He is. I love him dearly.

279
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,873
Not to say that I don't worry about him.

280
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,662
What's to worry about?

281
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,295
You know what?
I'm talking out of school.

282
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,052
Speaking of which,
he's allowed to live near them now.

283

Hey, guys!

284
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,552
- Oh, great, Stuart, you're here.
- Yes, Stuart.

285
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,181
Yeah, I didn't, I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

286
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,263
Hmm. I believe that.

287
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,186
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

288
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,434
Sorry guys, it's work.
I've got to take it.

289
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,234
- I'm so glad you made it, Stuart.
- Oh, yeah, so glad.

290
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,691
I can't believe you went behind my back.

291
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,952
Which clearly means I want this more.

292
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,780
You wanna play a game
of "who's more desperate" with me,

293

'cause you're in
the big leagues now, Bucko.

294
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,288
Look, Ruchi and I
are really hitting it off.

295
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,044
Please let me just have this one.

296
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,506
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm like a fungus you can't get rid of.

297
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,300
Sorry. So what's going on?

298
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,804
Oh, you just missed Stuart's funny story
about the fungus he can't get rid of.

299
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,514
Raj didn't tell me about tonight,
so he could be alone with you.

300
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,067
Really? That's a little weird.

301
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,736
Just a little?
Because I can work with that.

302
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,983
Look, guys, I'm not interested
in dating anyone right now.

303
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,822
I'm just looking to make some friends.

304
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,074
Yeah, I totally understand.

305
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,247
But if you were gonna date someone,
would it be me or Stuart?

306
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:09,826
I think I'm gonna go.

Ruchi, I'm sorry.

00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,832
If you still wanna
hang out as friends, I'd like that.

314
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,575
I, uh...

315
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,532
I got flip-flops.

316
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,831
Good for you.

317
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,504
Oh, my God! What happened?

318
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,257
After I got the flip-flops, I realized

319
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,460
that the tops of my feet
were exposed.

320
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,175
So, I put on some sunscreen,

321
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,427
which caused my feet to become slippery.

322
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:09,682
And predictably, one of them fell off
and went down a sewer grate.

323
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,355
Now normally, I would have walked away,

324
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,685
but this is a new, laid back me.

325
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:20,776
So, instead of getting upset
I just reached down to grab it.

326
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,616
That's when I touched something furry.

327
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,865
Which I'm telling myself,
was a damp toupee.

328
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,832
When the toupee licked my hand,

329
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:43,424
I screamed and hopped down the street
on my remaining flip-flop.

330
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,222
- Can I just ask--
- This is a long story,

331
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,141
why don't we please
save your questions till the end?

332
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,597
So, I finally came upon a bus bench

333
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,395
where I sat and removed one of my shirts

334
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,481
and, fashioned it
into a makeshift shoe.

335
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,238
Not a waterproof shoe.

336
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,691
That is relevant
to the next part of my story,

337
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:09,241
the ankle-deep puddle
of warm apple juice.

338
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,741
Apple juice?

339
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,414
Maybe, maybe not.

340
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,716
I'm telling myself a lot of things, Amy.

341
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,969
What happened to your other flip-flop?

342
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,262
(STUTTERS) Oh, that involves
what I'm telling myself

343
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,184
was a melted candy bar.

344
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:35,805
(SIGHS)

345
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,354
(STUTTERS) I'm sorry.

346
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,069
Is there anything I can do to help?

347
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,729
Yes.

348
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,907
I want you to be in charge
of our wedding.

349
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,034
Just you tell me where and when,

350
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,572
and I will show up with a boutonniere,
and close-toed shoes,

351
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:56,834
and, a Star Trek uniform
underneath my tuxedo.

352
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,796
That last part is non-negotiable.

353
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,337
Are you sure that's what you want?

354
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,295
<i>As sure as
I'm about to go bathe 'm Pure“.</i>

355
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,724
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

356
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,896
You know, ever since I was a young girl,

357
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,145
I've dreamed of a June wedding,

358
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:21,901
maybe on a cliff

359
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,103
overlooking the ocean at sunset.

360
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,064
Sure.

361
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,612
Sounds wonderful.

362
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,745
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go clean up.

363
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,125
Outdoor wedding.

364
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,674
SHELDON: I know what I'll be using
that cliff for.

365
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,437
I call this meeting
of the Council of Sheldons to order.

366
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,392
Let's take roll.

367
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,978
Science Sheldon.

368
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,434
Present.

369
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,395
Texas Sheldon.

370
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,813
Howdy.

371
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,738
Fanboy Sheldon.

372
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,319
Greetings.

373
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,789
Germophobe Sheldon.

374
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,416
Say it, don't spray it.

375
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,621
Where is Jock Sheldon?

376
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,503
Not the time, Humorous Sheldon.

377
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,004
Okay. New business.

378
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,515
Do we grant Laid-back Sheldon

379
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:35,758
a seat on the council?

380
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,348
Hey, whatever you guys want.

381
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,474
I'm just chilling like Bob Dylan.

382
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,106
- Negative.
- Heck, no.

383
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,778
I don't feel well.

384
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,946
(HONKS)

385
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,318
Can we kick him out, too?

386
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,387
