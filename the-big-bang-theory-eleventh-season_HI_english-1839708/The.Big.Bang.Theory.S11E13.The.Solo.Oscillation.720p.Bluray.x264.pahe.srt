00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,514
Hey! Look what I got everybody.

2
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:08,009
Newspapers?

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,560
Did you find a portal back
to the 1990s?

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,314
No. If he had that,
he'd be trying to prevent NSYNC

5
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,766
from breaking up.

6
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,688
Oh, please. I'm glad they broke up.

7
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,521
Otherwise, Justin would
never have brought sexy back.

8

One thing you can't get
on an iPad,

9
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,410
the smell of ink and paper.

10
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,033
One more reason
iPads are better.

11
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:32,082
They reviewed
my planetarium show.

12
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,161
Yeah. It's on page three
of the Arts and Leisure section.

13
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,429
Oh, look, they still have Far Side.

14
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,305
I don't get that one.

15
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,222
Oh. He's pushing
when he should be pulling.

16
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,679
I don't think he belongs
in that gifted school, then.

17
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,857
- What are you doing?
- Making a boat.

18

When I was a kid,
my dad showed me how.

19

Boy, you'll do anything
to avoid reading.

20

Guys, it's under
"Things to do this weekend."

21
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,734
I can't find it.
What does it say?

22
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:09,491
That it's a thing
to do this weekend.

23

Well, you didn't tell me that.

It's just a little blurb.

What have you been
working on these days?

35
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,311
Ooh, where'd that come from?

36
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,015
Where did what come from?

Oh, my God, let it go.

Can you believe this guy?

42
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,868
I did it!

43
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,286
See? It's a boat.

Okay, how do you want
to play this?

47
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,285
Do you want to pretend like
nothing's bothering you

48
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,113
and blow up later,
or do you just want to be

50
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,000
Nothing is bothering me.

Fine. Be that way.

I have a confession.

55
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:52,006
When I berated Leonard,

56
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,888
it was a clever ruse
to conceal the fact

57
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,014
that I'm not
working on anything.

58
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,475

when I say, "No!"

60
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:06,695
The truth is I have
nothing of interest to pursue.

61
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,156
Well, maybe this is
the perfect opportunity

62
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,905
to take some time
for yourself and refocus.

00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,699
I'm sure you'll find something
you're excited about.

I think we should
start with something

78
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,539
that gets them up on their feet.

the roof off this place,

Hi there, Shelly.
You will never believe

who I ran into
at the barbecue festival.

116

I don't have time for this

Then why did you
answer the phone?

119
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,882
Because you raised me
to be polite.

120

Now stop bothering me.

121

Hello again.

00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,464
Who did you see
at the barbecue festival?

123
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,428
Mr. Watkins.

Yeah. Really?

00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,515
You called me and interrupted
my work to tell me

126
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,094
that you ran into somebody
you could plausibly run into?

I'm sorry, Mother,
I really need to focus here.

Okay, sweetheart.
I'll talk to you then.

I thought Mr. Watkins
moved to Florida.

00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,450
He did.
He was back visiting his son.

Oh, gosh darn it,
that is interesting.

Was it Tommy or Joe?

134
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,585
I bet it was Joe, 'cause
he and Tommy had a falling out

back over and we hung out.

take off all of her clothes.

then go to bed early.

but I just don't think
I have the time.

And other events that
people can't leave.

158
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,325
I don't want to be the one
who breaks up the band.

160
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,658
think about replacing me.

<i>- Okay.
- I mean...</i>

162
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,242
I know it'll be hard since we-

163
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,044
I bet Bert could do it.
He plays guitar.

164
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,667
I'm gonna go ask him.

165
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,301
I guess he forgot that
I play the cello.

166
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,009
I don't think he did.

167
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,635
Okay, I think it's ready.

168
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,178
Should we put on safety goggles?

169
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,764
Well, the funnest fun
is the safest fun, so yes.

170
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,811
Hey.

171
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,937
- Hi.
- Hello.

172
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,395
Amy, you're here, again.

173
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,068
Yeah, Sheldon said he needed
another night to work,

174
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,865
so I said I'd give him some space.

175
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,071
So what's all this?

176
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,744
Well, Amy and I were talking
about old science fair projects

177
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,366
and how fun it would be
to recreate them.

178
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,993
We're making hot ice.

179
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,328
It's pretty cool.

180
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,458
- Nice one.
- Yeah.

181
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,085
Turns out we both

182
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,539
did this as our science fair
projects in ninth grade.

183
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,545
Do you remember any of
your high school projects?

184
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,298
Uh... Well,
I remember telling Jenny Runyon

185
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,345
that I would teach her
how to flirt with boys

186
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,094
if she put my name on her project.

187
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,221
I got an "A," she got pregnant.

188
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,937
Girls like you are why I had to
come straight home after school.

189
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,395
Check this out.

190
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,277
PENNY: Look <i>at</i> that.

191
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,484
<i>Wow, that's amazing.</i>

192
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,487
<i>LEONARD: Mmm-hmm. The crystallization is
an exothermic process,</i>

193
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,909
<i>so the ice is actually hot.</i>

194
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:30,074
-I won first place for this.
- So did I.

195
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,996
I threw Jenny's baby shower.

196
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,491
Oh. Hey, in seventh grade,

197
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,372
I built a cobra wave.
You want to do that?

198
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,661
Oh. We can come up with
a wave speed formula,

199
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,964
and see how accurately
we can predict the amplitude.

200
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,461
Wow, I didn't think
anything could top

201
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,089
last night's spelling bee,
but here comes math.

202
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,589
I'm sorry, we don't
have to do more experiments.

203
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,514
Let's do something we can all enjoy.

204
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,847
Hey, you want to watch
that show you like

205
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,600
where people want to buy a house
and then they do?

206
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,315
No, no, you guys do your experiments.
I'll go pick up dinner.

207
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,313
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, you're having science fun,

208
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,986
and I don't want to interfere,
or watch you.

209
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,414
Did I actually do it?

210
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,327
(EXCLAIMS) I did. I did.

211
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,503
The answer is one in 18 million.

212
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,092
What is?

213
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,755
The odds of you
running into Mr. Watkins.

214
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,258
Oh, Shelly. I have bad news.

215
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,434
Mr. Watkins passed this morning.

216
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,103
Oh!

217
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,597
I'm sorry.

218
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,024
I know. What are the odds of that?

219
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,769
Call you back.

220
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,577
<i>LEONARD:
Now, let's calculate the amplitude!</i>

221
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,074
<i>ANN:
All right!</i>

222
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,462
Sheldon? Sheldon? Sheldon?

223
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,918
It's annoying when you do it.

224
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:10,970
I brought pizza.

225
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,843
Oh, thank you.

226
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,474
I have been working pretty hard.

227
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,801
I could use a break.

228
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,510
What's that?

229
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,596
Yeah, that is an experiment

230
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,273
to see how many parallelograms
I could draw

231
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,225
while holding my breath.

232
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,021
Is that where you blacked out?

233
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,989
No, actually,

234
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,987
that's where I blacked out.

235
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,569
And this?

236
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,824
That is a list

237
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,748
of all the different types
of natural disasters.

238
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,165
"Fire-quake"?

239
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,919
I made that one up.

240
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,335
Which I shouldn't have,
because now I'm scared of it.

241
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,509
Hey, I thought you were
working on actual science.

242
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:50,627
<i>I am.</i>

243
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,804
I'm trying to come up with
a new approach to dark matter,

244
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,722
but people keep distracting me.

245
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,175
First, my mother kept answering
the phone when I called,

246
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,851
even though she knew
I was busy.

247
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,767
And now you show up
with my favorite shape of food.

248
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,395
A circle made of triangles
served in a square box.

249
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,769
Maybe I'll just eat this
in the laundry room.

250
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,104
No, no. Wait.

251
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:13,067
You don't have to go, as long as you
sit quietly and don't say anything.

252
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,742
Fine.

253
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,824
Mmm.

254
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,706
Good.

255
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,670
Are you mocking me?

256
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,932
Hey, you want to hear
one of my geology songs?

257
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,218
So it's about rocks?

258
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,395
Better. It's about a boulder.

259
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,726
Isn't that the same thing?

260
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,145
Far from it.

261
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:50,112
A boulder has a diameter
greater than 25.6 centimeters.

262
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,230
Is that fact in the song?

263
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,648
No.

264
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,817
Yes.

265
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,404
It's sung from the viewpoint
of the boulder

266
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,330
that chases Indiana Jones.

267
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,909
That's right up our alley.
Let's hear it.

268
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,201
Okay.

269
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,203
(SINGING)

270
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:11,542
<i>Alone in my temple
in the middle of Peru</i>

271
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,344
<i>A giant stone ball
with nothing much to do</i>

272
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,469
<i>But if you steal my idol</i>

273
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,802
<i>I will roll right over you</i>

274
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:27,023
<i>'Cause I'm six tons of
granite and Micaceous Schist</i>

275
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,110
<i>Yeah I'm six tons of granite and</i>

276
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,653
<i>Micaceous Schist</i>

277
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:35,983
<i>Yeah, I'm six tons of granite
and Micaceous Schist</i>

278
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,405
<i>Yeah I'm six tons of granite and</i>

279
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,657
<i>Micaceous Schist</i>

280
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:43,994
So, I think if we want

281
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,371
to predict the height
of the wave, we need to use

282
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,874
elasticity theory and model the lattice

283
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,373
as one continuous flexible piece.

284
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,919
This is fun.

285
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,546
Playing with Popsicle sticks,

286
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,878
exploring ways
to store kinetic energy.

287
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,055
It's like preschool all over again.

288
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,050
Except now if I eat paste,
it's because I want to,

289
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:04,306
not because
Craig Schultz is making me.

290
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,639
Hey, can I ask you a question?

291
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:08,814
Is it, "Where was the teacher?"

292
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,109
She was in the bathroom smoking,
that's where.

293
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,359
It wasn't, but I'm glad
to see you've moved on.

294
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,408
I was gonna ask if being married
felt any different.

295
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,818
Oh.

296
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,533
Not really.

297
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,957
Sorry. That probably wasn't
the answer you were looking for.

298
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,000
No, actually it is.

299
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,704
I mean, Sheldon and I are in
a really great place right now,

300
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,373
and ljust, I don't want
anything to mess that up.

301
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,382
Mmm-hmm. You do remember you're here

302
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,677
because he kicked you
out of your apartment?

303
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:39,879
Yes.

304
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,972
His work is important to him.

305
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,727
It's one of the things I find
the sexiest about him.

306
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,146
Well, that and-

307
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,315
His butt.

308
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,449
And then, I was thinking about

309
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,401
inventing a new
dark matter particle

310
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,407
to evade the omega
baryon constraints,

311
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,863
but that just seems like something

312
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,414
anyone could come up with.

313
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,584
Hmm. Agreed. (CLEARS THROAT)

314
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,127
You know what's blowing my mind?

315
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,212
Somebody thought about
putting cheese in this crust.

316
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,096
ljust wish I could find
something that excites me.

317
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,764
You do understand that
crust doesn't normally

318
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,717
come with cheese in it?

319
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,851
Okay, all right, look.

320
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,893
What got you excited about
dark matter in the first place?

321
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,108
Well, I left string theory,

322
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,651
which I'd been working
on for a long time,

323
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,855
and everyone was talking about
how cool dark matter was,

324
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,691
and I thought, "Well, sure,
I'll give that a whirl."

325
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,077
So it's your rebound science?

326
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,579
What's that?

327
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,703
Well, not the science you spend
the rest of your life with,

328
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,205
but the one you use to make
yourself feel pretty again.

329
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,123
Well, if I'm being honest,

330
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,083
I never forgot about string theory.

331
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,467
I mean, it's remarkable.

332
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,342
It's the closest we've come
to a theory of everything,

333
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,970
something even Einstein
couldn't figure out.

334
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,351
Well, if he couldn't figure
it out, maybe it's just wrong.

335
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:11,938
But it's so elegant.

336
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:15,017
I mean, look, string theory posits

337
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:18,062
that the fundamental particles
we see in three dimensions

338
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:23,275
are actually strings embedded
in multidimensional space-time.

339
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,323
Interesting.

340
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,614
So that would mean,

341
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,703
that...

342
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,124
Can't do this by myself, buddy.

343
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,719
What is happening?

344
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,886
I was trying not to wake you.

345
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,599
Did it work?

346
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,726
Sorry.

347
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,557
ljust realized,

348
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,737
now that I'm not in the band,
I can focus on my own music.

349
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,156
You know? Go solo.

350
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,655
You said you were
taking a break from the band

351
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,281
to help with me and the baby.

352
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,039
Yes, and write an astronaut musical.

353
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,330
Picture this.
The curtain opens.

354
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,917
There's a lone astronaut floating
in the inky blackness of space.

355
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,248
Maybe wires,
maybe fog.

356
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,504
I'll let the director figure that out.

357
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,584
(SINGING)

358
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,797
<i>I really don't know when</i>

359
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:32,386
<i>I'll run out of oxygen</i>

360
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,935
Good news! I'm back in the band!

361
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,309
So Bernadette doesn't mind?

362
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,315
It was her idea!

363
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,612
So it's sort of like a guitar string,

364
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,659
but instead of making an actual sound,

365
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,953
each vibration is a different particle.

366
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,498
Precisely. And when
you express it in 11 dimensions,

367
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,747
Einstein's relativity equations pop out.

368
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:57,952
Does that sound like a coincidence?

369
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,833
- It does not.
- Yep.

370
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,214
That's what I think.

371
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,384
So, did we do it?
Did we just solve string theory?

372
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,627
Oh!

373
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,138
I appreciate your enthusiasm,

374
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,681
but this is not the sort of thing

375
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,928
we can figure out in a night.

376
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,010
People have been
stuck on this for decades.

377
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,720
What, decades? Really?

378
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,898
It's a string.
How hard can it be?

379
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,767
It's straight, it's in a loop,

380
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,023
it gets knotted up
with other strings.

381
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,028
Well, actually there are no knots

382
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,981
in anything greater
than four dimensions.

383

(STUTTERS) Unless

384
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:33,322
we get around that
by considering them as sheets.

385
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,240
You know, topologically speaking,

386
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,418
that has
a lot of interesting possibilities.

387
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,166
See? How long did that take me,
like a minute?

388
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,340
Thought you were getting us dinner.

389
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,921
Sorry.
I had to stop at Sheldon's

390
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,348
and help him solve string theory.

391
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,308
What?

392
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,644
Yeah, turns out the answer's knots.

393
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,692
That's cute,
but you can't have knots

394
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,145
in more than four dimensions.

395
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,481
Mmm. You can
if you consider them sheets.
