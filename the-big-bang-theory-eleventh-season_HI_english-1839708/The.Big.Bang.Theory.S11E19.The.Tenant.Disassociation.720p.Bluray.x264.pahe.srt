1
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:06,219
Why are you wearing a Band-Aid?

2
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:07,595
Halley bit me.

3
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,885
(LAUGHS) You got beaten up by a girl.

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:12,763
Hey, that's sexist.

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,014
You're right.

6
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,065
(LAUGHS) You got beaten up by a baby.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,652
- Hi.
- Hey.

8
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,146
Whatcha got there?

9
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,194
I grabbed a sandwich
from the food truck out front.

10
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:27,988
(STAMMERS) Hold on, tonight is Friday
and I believe you know what that means.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,039
That my fun, young life
took a drastic turn somewhere.

12
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,289
- No.
- But, yeah.

13
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,121
No, that means it's Chinese food night.

14
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,382
Yeah, and you have Chinese food,
so eat it.

15
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,881
But, I can smell your pastrami.

16
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,554
And we can all hear your complaining,
so, no one's happy.

17
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,052
It does smell good.

18
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,474
It is, I had one the other day.

19
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,055
What is happening?

20
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,554
Everybody's supposed to be
eating Chinese food.

21
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,728
Well, actually, I believe the Chinese
may have invented the sandwich.

22
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:00,274
Their dish "rou jia mo" literally means
"meat between bread."

23
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,690
So, looks like all of us, including
Penny, are eating Chinese food.

24
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,987
Except for you Sheldon,
you're eating crow.

25
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,787
I'm sorry, I think you're forgetting
that the sandwich

26
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,332
was invented by John Montagu,
the Earl of Sandwich.

27
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,786
Oh! The truck's called
Pearl of Sandwich. Now, I get it. Mmm.

28
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:22,333
All right, that smells too good.
I gotta get one of those.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,049
And, I think you're forgetting that
there are written documents

30
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:30,053
of meat between bread being eaten
in China during the Tang Dynasty.

31
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,018
You know what, I'll go with you.
And then, maybe we just go home.

32
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,139
I think you're defining bread
very loosely.

33
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,937
If we go down that road,
where does it end?

34
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:42,187
I would say when we go to bed,
but you talk in your sleep.

35
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,901
I don't want to get into this
with you right now.

36
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,607
We'll talk about this when I'm asleep.

37
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,282
I don't wanna talk about it
when you're asleep.

38
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,863
How come we can't talk about it now?

39
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,285
Because I'm eating now.

40
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,787
Fine, how's your Moo shu?

41
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,206
You know what, it's great.

42
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,587
What? Look at that.

43
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:02,669
Hmm.

44
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,467
Maybe the Chinese did invent
the sandwich.

45
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,379
I guess you were right.

46
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,091
Too bad no one's around to hear it.

47
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,136
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

48
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,497
I can smell that food truck
from up here.

49
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,259
Just close the window
if you don't like the smell.

50
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,922
Of course, I like the smell,
it's salt and fat.

51
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,928
My brain may be evolved

52
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,805
but my tongue still wants to
pick up a club

53
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,511
and drag that truck back to my cave.

54
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,516
So there's something you like
but it's also driving you crazy.

55
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,814
Been there, doing it now.

56
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,480
No, it's a distraction.

57
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,486
Now, how can I focus on my work
when all I can think about

58
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,029
is how much I want that sandwich?

59
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,448
So, go get one.

60
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,197
I can't just give into every urge
I have when I have it.

61
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,164
That's why I have a rigid schedule.

62
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,247
It's bad enough I had to give into
my urge to create a rigid schedule.

63
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,749
You know, why don't ljust go down
to the food truck and ask them to move?

64
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,501
- Why are you taking cash?
- No reason.

65
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:39,137
Ah! This is the life.
What could be better than this?

66
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,189
If you weren't wearing
one of my swimsuits.

67
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,142
I'll give it back.

68
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,898
Huh. You know the rule.

69
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,901
Once it touches heinie,
it's no longer miney.

70
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:55,494
You're such a prude. Do you know all the
things this water is touching right now?

71
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,329
Well, I'm relaxed enough.

72
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,576
Hey, Howard, look.

73
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,619
What's that?

74
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,542
HOWARD: Huh.

75
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,295
Looks like someone's drone.

76
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,256
Oh, no, do you it was spying on us
in the hot tub?

77
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,755
'Cause I'm only 40% of the way
to my beach-bod.

78
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:19,351
One of the propellers is broken,
it must've crashed.

79
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,561
Oh. Do you think you could fix it?

80
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,522
Maybe. Should we try
and track down the owner first?

81
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,813
Yeah. That's probably a good idea.

82
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:28,943
Anyone lose a drone?

83
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,731
Looks like it's ours.

84
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,361
Yay, we got a drone!

85
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,160
- Shh!
-(WHISPERS) Oh! Yay, we got a drone.

86
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,876
The pastrami truck moved.

87
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,585
That is the danger
of a restaurant on wheels.

88
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,003
No, apparently someone complained
to the tenants association.

89
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,712
They're not allowed to park
on our street anymore.

90
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,057
Who would complain about something
that everyone loves? Oh.

91
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,720
Did you complain to the tenants
association about the food truck?

92
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,560
- Yes.
- PENNY: Wha...

93
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,017
They actually took you seriously?
(SIGHS)

94
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,187
Oh, the tenants association
takes every complaint seriously.

95
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,905
Great, because I'm about to send them
an email complaining about you.

96
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,277
-(PENNY SIGHS)
-(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

97
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,033
Excuse me.

98
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,452
Wow.

99
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,081
Someone should have spell-checked.

100
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,635
- What is going on here?
- You're the tenants association?

101
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,842
(LAUGHS) You should see
the look on your face.

102
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,760
And you might want to tell your wife
that there's no "Y" in pastrami.

103
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,349
Okay, that oughta do it,

104
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:53,859
I've replaced the propeller and
reattached the gimbal controller unit.

105
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,781
Dude, you're like
Grey's Anatomy for robots.

106
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,277
Also, why isn't that a show?

107
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,450
I just need to see if I can re-sync
the controls to this old remote.

108
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,700
We should name it.

109
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,206
What? The drone
or your stupid robot show?

110
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:15,175
The drone. The show's already
got a name, General <i>Bot-spital.</i>

111
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:17,928
(WHIRRING)

112
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,380
I got it working! (CHUCKLES)

113
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,340
RAJESH: Oh! Oh!

114
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,721
Let's play William Tell.

115
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,310
I'll put this bowl on my head,

116
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,641
see if you can knock it off
without hitting me.

117
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,141
You read my mind.

118
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,439
What are you doing?

119
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,064
Either breaking a bowl
or breaking Raj's head.

120
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,404
Be careful, they don't make
that bowl anymore.

121
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,288
It's a nice one.

122
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,455
Yeah, we found it in the yard
and fixed it up.

123
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,881
Aren't you worried there's some kid
out there missing his drone?

124
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,001
Oh, please, Bernadette,
this is not a children's toy, okay?

125
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,961
This thing's got a HD camera on it.

126
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,051
Okay, then aren't you worried
there's some rich Peeping Tom

127
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,427
out there missing his drone?

128
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:09,563
We asked around and no one claimed it.
Ha. I think we've done all we can do.

129
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,808
Did you check the video card?

130
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,355
Maybe you could see
where it started off from.

131
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,024
(WHISPERS) What a great idea, honey.

132
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,320
So, let me get this straight,

133
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,702
you are the president
of the tenants association?

134
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,701
President, only member
and harshest critic.

135
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,669
I once gave myself an official reprimand
for conducting a meeting in the shower.

136
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,832
The steam warped my gavel.

137
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,673
Okay, so, when I got a fine for leaving
my clothes in the dryer too long,

138
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:41,753
that was from you?

139
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,557
$14.99, the exact price of a new gavel.

140
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:51,013
And the noise complaint we got
for singing you "Happy Birthday?"

141
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,141
As a friend, I was touched.

142
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,809
As a representative of the building,

143
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,735
I thought that you should pick a key
and stick with it.

144
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,481
Hi.

145
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,862
Do you know he's
the entire tenants association?

146
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,160
No, but I'm not surprised.

147
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,955
He's also the pope of a planet
he invented in hyperspace.

148
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,200
Why didn't you tell me?

149
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,253
I wanted to make that sure
you loved the man, not the office.

150
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,874
You can't just
declare yourself president.

151
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,167
I didn't. I called a meeting,

152
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,844
I was the only one to attend,

153
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:23,962
I nominated myself

154
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,764
and after a pretty moving speech,
I voted myself in.

155
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,683
Well, if you can vote yourself in,
then we can vote you out.

156
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,855
- Yeah.
- Fine make a motion at the next meeting.

157
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,931
When is that?

158
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,267
It's the first Saturday
of every month.

159
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,976
Unless there's an emergency meeting.

160
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,485
Then we call an emergency meeting.

161
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,072
You don't really have to,
this is the first Saturday of the month.

162
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,199
Okay, fine, then, we vote you out.

163
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,073
(STAMMERS) Hold 0n, hold on,

164
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,409
first, we have to read the minutes
from last month's meeting.

165
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,583
Amy, would you do the honors?

166
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,039
Why not?

167
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,252
"Saturday, March third,
7:05, meeting called to order.

168
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,626
"7:06, president gets shampoo in eye."

169
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,881
SHELDON: Mmm-hmm.

170
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,171
"7:07, meeting adjourned."

171
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,340
Okay, can we vote you out now?

172
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,142
Ah! Very well. New business.

173
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,730
I move for a vote of no confidence
in the president.

174
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,557
- Yeah.
- Two to one, you lose.

175
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,191
Not so fast.

176
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,399
I believe we have one tenant here
who has not made her voice heard.

177
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,774
Oh.

178
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,070
We're waiting, fiancée.

179
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,744
Yeah, we're waiting, best friend.

180
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,284
Yeah, we're waiting,

181
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,703
neighbor who needed a battery

182
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,256
and totally got one from me,
no strings attached.

183
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,426
I don't wanna be in the middle of this.

184
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,263
No matter which way I vote,
I'm either a bad friend,

185
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,804
a bad fiancée or
an ungrateful recipient of a battery.

186
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,766
Next time I have a meeting
in the shower, you're welcome to attend.

187
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,813
Sheldon, Sheldon for president,
I pick Sheldon.

188
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,157
Can't believe my best friend
sided with Sheldon.

189
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,820
Can't believe my best friend is Sheldon.

190
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,618
Ugh. I should've taken that gavel
and shoved it right down his throat.

191
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,326
Ugh. I would've gone the other way
but it would've gotten to this throat.

192
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,537
What?

193
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,089
Don't be mad at me,
I mean, I can't vote against him.

194
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,583
What? Even when he's being crazy?

195
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,259
What other times are there?

196
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,174
So you'll just let him
get away with anything?

197
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,554
Well, not anything,

198
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,184
but honestly, pastrami sandwich
is not the hill I want to die on.

199
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,638
It's not about the sandwich,
it's about the principle.

200
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,977
Yeah, principle.
And a little bit sandwich.

201
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,057
Yeah.

202
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,856
Look, there are a bunch of other
tenants in this building,

203
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,028
all you need is
for one of them to vote your way,

204
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,527
and then Sheldon's out
and I didn't betray him.

205
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,234
Hey, you know
that's actually a good plan.

206
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,069
That you came up with all by yourself.

207
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,165
Now, if you'll excuse me,

208
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,330
told Sheldon I was going to the market

209
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,165
so taking some of your stuff.

210
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,888
I was never here.

211
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,178
Sometimes you don't see it
'cause she's next to Sheldon,

212
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,387
but she's pretty weird.

213
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,942
Okay, all hooked up. Here we go.

214
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,361
(SIGHS) I hope there's
nothing disturbing on there.

215
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,939
Like you two in a hot tub?

216
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,489
Hold on, now I'm getting a picture.

217
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,666
It's not very much to go on.

218
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,915
Oh, that's plenty to go on.

219
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,207
We can't give up, we gotta find her.

220
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,927
You just wanna find her
'cause she's cute.

221
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,967
Not just because she's cute.

222
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,840
She also owns a pretty expensive drone

223
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,551
which means she has money
and doesn't mind wasting it

224
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,344
and I... I like that in a woman.

225
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,139
Do you see anything
that can help us locate her?

226
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,933
Mmm, let me have a look.

227
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,142
She's got eagle eyes.

228
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,653
Always spotting
continuity errors in movies.

229
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,776
(CHUCKLES) It's not annoying at all.

230
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,617
Oh, there. Right there.

231
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,953
Check out the pin on her jacket,
isn't that from the comic book store?

232
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,448
Mmm. ls it? Hey, Howard, zoom in.

233
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,035
Fine, zooming in.

234
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,539
(VOCALIZES WHOOSHING)

235
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,632
Yeah, I know you're being a jerk,
but it's actually helpful.

236
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:33,962
Hey.

237
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,718
Hi, we're your neighbors
from downstairs.

238
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,052
We've met.

239
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,970
Remember I invited you
to my housewarming when I moved in?

240
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,097
Oh, yeah, sorry, you know,
it's been a crazy couple of months.

241
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,891
That was two years ago.

242
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,811
Welcome to the building.

243
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,278
So I'm running for
president of the tenants association,

244
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,654
I could really use your vote.

245
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,782
You said you were gonna stop by,
I bought a lot of food.

246
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,374
Anyway, meeting's tomorrow,
we really hope you can make it.

247
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,331
- I'll be there.
- Ah, really?

248
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,412
Yeah, you should buy a lot of food.

249
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,963
So, I'm running for
president of the tenants association

250
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,085
and I could really use your vote.

251
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:15,545
Uh, who's president now?

252
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,804
Uh, Sheldon Cooper.

253
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,887
You know, about yay tall
and about yay annoying.

254
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,388
(CHUCKLES)

255
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,386
So you want me to vote
against Sheldon Cooper?

256
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,013
Yeah. You just need to show up
at a meeting and-

257
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,481
Oh, no, no, no can do.

258
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,058
He's got a restraining order against me.

259
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,560
Really? Why?

260
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,529
I locked him on the roof once.
(LAUGHS, WHISPERS) Three times.

261
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,533
So, Mrs. Petrescu, we were hoping

262
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,115
you would vote for Leonard
instead of voting for Sheldon.

263
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,654
Vote Sheldon.

264
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,749
No, no, vote Leonard.

265
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,326
No, vote Leonard.

266
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,626
No. Vote Leonard.

267
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,629
Thank you.

268
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,974
She's wearing a pin from your store.
Do you know who she is?

269
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,141
Oh, sure, yeah, that's Cynthia.

270
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,893
Wha... So she's a customer?

271
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,896
Yeah, yeah,
but I... I haven't seen her in a while.

272
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,607
And before you say anything,
there's a lot of reasons

273
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,730
women stop coming here,
it's not just me.

274
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,687
But this time?

275
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,356
It was me. Yeah.

276
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,493
I was trying out a flirty new smile.

277
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:29,203
Now, I don't use
the word "ghoulish" a lot

278
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,498
(SIGHS) but ljust can't think
of another word.

279
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,176
Wait, do you know how to find her?

280
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,046
Yeah, I think I have her address
on my mailing list.

281
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,674
Hey, please let me bring
the drone back to her.

282
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,768
You think you've got a shot?
What if she's married?

283
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,141
- She's not.
-It's meant to be.

284
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,275
Little tip. Uh,
stick with the smiles you know.

285
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,565
Hi, what are you doing?

286
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,490
Leonard and Penny are trying to turn
the tenants against me.

287
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,700
So they are about to see
just what kind of power

288
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,248
the president
of the tenants association wields.

289
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,119
"You must be at least this tall
to use washing machine."

290
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,582
I'm going to hang it up higher
than Leonard.

291
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,252
Then his clothes will smell

292
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,963
and nobody's voting for a man
with smelly clothes. No.

293
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,262
Not when there's a perfectly
unscented incumbent on the ballot.

294
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,896
Sheldon, I have an advanced degree
in the study of the human brain,

295
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,979
so if my fiancé's a raving lunatic,
it's kind of a ding on my reputation.

296
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,650
If leaders just stepped aside every time
they didn't have the consent

297
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,273
of the governed, what would we have?

298
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,907
Democracy.

299
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:45,866
Not on my watch.

300
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,045
Okay, don't be weird,
don't be weird, don't be weird.

301
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,122
(IN DEEP VOICE) Hello.

302
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,087
Hey, you found my drone.

303
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,053
Yeah, yes, it took a while
to track you down,

304
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,597
but to see the look on your face,
it was worth it.

305
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,007
Aw.

306
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,091
That's sweet. (CHUCKLES)

307
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,426
Rajesh.

308
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,261
- Cynthia.
- Pleasure to meet you.

309
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,603
Likewise.

310
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,940
I feel like I should give you
a reward or something.

Thanks. So, I'll call you, Cynthia.

00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,888
Hey, Sheldon,
we found something pretty interesting.

321
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,807
Huh.

322
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,513
Well, that is surprising.

323
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,480
I for one have no idea
what they're talking about.

324
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,233
Turns out, when Amy took over
Penny's apartment

325
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,781
she was put on the lease, not you.

326
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,400
Yeah and when I moved across the hall

327
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,577
you got taken off the lease
and I got added.

328
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,862
What are you saying?

329
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,912
That Sheldon's not technically
a tenant at all

330
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,127
and therefore has no standing to be
president of the tenants association

331
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,624
no matter who votes for him?

332
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:23,001
I don't know how you found that out
but I'm guessing all on your own.

333
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,092
So looks like we need to figure out
who the new president should be.

334
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,889
- I nominate myself.
- I second it.

335
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,682
Huh.

336
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,641
Well, as a woman in love,
I want to stand by my man.

337
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,981
Too bad that's been rendered
bureaucratically impossible.

338
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,023
Well, this is hard for me

339
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,731
because I do love a legal technicality,

340
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,152
and this is a good one.

341
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,070
Although not quite as good
as the provision in California law

342
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:54,449
which states a person who occupies
a dwelling for thirty consecutive days

343
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,830
becomes a tenant at will. And as such-

344
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,126
- I vote for Leonard.
- You...

What?

346
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:02,632
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

347
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,626
With minimal power
comes minimal responsibility,

348
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,295
and you couldn't handle it.

349
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,462
You-

350
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,386
Don't you misquote Spider-Man to me.

351
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,060
It's not your fault.

352
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,270
I mean, what man
wouldn't be seduced by the power

353
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,473
To decide how late
the laundry room stays open?

354
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,939
Wait, you're the reason I had to come
back and get my jeans the next morning?

355
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,402
I can't believe you expect me
to give that up.

Well, it was, but you know what?

Instead of being in charge,
I can now be the vocal opposition,

criticizing and badgering
the president at every turn.
