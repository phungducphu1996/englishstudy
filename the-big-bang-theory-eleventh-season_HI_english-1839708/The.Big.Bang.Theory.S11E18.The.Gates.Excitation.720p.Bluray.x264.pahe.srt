1
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,139
But why do they still call Batman
using the Bat-Signal?

2
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:08,175
Wouldn't it just be, like,
easier to text him?

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,602
The Bat-Signal
isn't just to alert Batman,

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,850
it's also to strike fear
in the hearts of his enemies

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,977
and let them know he's coming.

6
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,058
Sort of like Sheldon's knock. (CHUCKLES)

7

Comparing me to Batman? I'll take it.

8
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,817
If we don't do anything how long do you
think they'll talk about Batman?

9
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:28,913
Well, I've known them for 11 years,
so 11 years.

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,658
I believe they do text him.

11
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,210
The Bat-Signal is linked
to his phone via Bluetooth.

12
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:36,791
Has that been in the comics?

13
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,129
No, it's just what I believe.

14

All right, I'm putting a stop to this.

15
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,343
If you knew how,
why'd you wait eleven years?

16
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,763
Hey, guys, guess what?

17
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:50,676
Today at work I found out
I'm going to meet Bill Gates.

Sorry, Leonard,
you and Penny had a good run.

00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,357
I'm not leaving him for Bill Gates.

21
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,693
Are you sure?
I bet his internet's really fast

22
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,570
How did this happen?

23
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,570
Well, his foundation is looking to
partner with a pharmaceutical company

24
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,823
to help develop affordable vaccines,
so they asked me to show him around.

25
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,787
That's great, when's he coming?

26
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,997
He gets in on Sunday, and Monday morning

27
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,167
I'm gonna give him a tour
of the labs and offices.

28

Oh.

29
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,129
He gets in on Sunday, April 1st.

30

when you sent me that email

36
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,974
with the photo attached
but you didn't attach a photo?

37
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:39,683
That was a mistake.

00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,526
Messing with me, yes, it was.

39
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:44,980

you've already fooled me, shame on you.

I'm hoping they'll consider me
for a PR position that's opening up.

Well, if you're nervous...

gonna do when he wants to talk about

What are high-level language
interpreters for micro-computers?

I'm prepared for tomorrow.

158
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,863
Do you think you could get Bill Gates
to sign something for me?

159
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,238
Yeah, maybe, like what?

160
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,327
My arm, my chest, his call.

161
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,831
His call will be to the police.

162
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:20,463
Penny, remember when I introduced you
to hundred calorie Dove Bars

163
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,087
and you said you owed me,
like, big time?

164
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,931
Guys, even if I wanted
to introduce you,

165
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,474
there is no room in his schedule.

166
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,054
I mean, look at this itinerary.

167
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,182
I meet him at his hotel
first thing tomorrow morning,

168
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,937
and then we're on the go all day long.

169
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,933
You're right. Guys, this is her job,
we need to respect that.

170
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,100
Thank you, honey.

171
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,309
Proud of you.

172
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,565
Love you.

173
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,108
I totally just saw
what hotel he's staying at.

174
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:47,660
What are we waiting here for?

175
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,371
For Penny to walk down the stairs,
get in her car and drive away.

176
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,616
Right, smart. (CLEARS THROAT)

177
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,164
That long enough?

178
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,248
She's pretty quick, let's go.

179
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,970
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

180
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,222
What would you do
if you had a billion dollars?

181
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,351
Same as Bill Gates,
try to make the world a better place,

182
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,024
but I'd do it
in a working Iron Man suit.

183
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,148
I didn't know that came
in a boys medium.

184
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,941
(STUTTERS) This is a bad idea,
maybe we should go.

185
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,571
What are you talking about?

186
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:28,735
(STUTTERS) I don't know,
I'm just feeling guilty

187
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,321
like I'm kinda sneaking around
behind Penny's back.

188
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,202
We're not doing anything wrong.

189
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,410
We're just hanging out in a hotel
lobby, plenty of people do that.

190
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,462
The businessmen,
the high-end prostitutes.

191
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,345
That's a fun new game, CEO or ho.

192
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,632
No, this is wrong, let's go.

193
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,014
Guys, guys, that's him. Be cool.

194
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,098
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

195
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:58,890
Cooler.

196
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:02,152
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

197
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,027
(STUTTERS) Mr. Gates,
I'm Doctor Leonard Hofstadter,

198
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,153
we've actually met before.

199
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:08,991
Sorry, I don't remember.

200
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:13,121
You were so nice... (STUTTERS)
And it was really special to me

201
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,540
because you've been
such a big influence on my life.

202
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,702
I mean, ever since I was a little kid,
I've looked up to you like a hero.

203
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,546
Oh, now I remember.

204
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,420
Would you like a tissue?

205
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,251
How about a hug?

206
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,128
How about a tissue?

207
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,599
Sorry I talked about my kids
the whole time.

208
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,469
Oh, don't worry about it.

209
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,726
I mean, besides you cutting up
my meat for me, it was a lovely lunch.

210
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,813
God, what's happening?

211
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,942
I'm a smart, educated, successful...
(STAMMERS)

212
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,564
Woman?

213
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,699
I was gonna get it.

214
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,569
Don't be so hard on yourself.

215
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,781
Pregnancy and childbirth
actually cause physical changes

216
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,324
to the structure of your brain.

217
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,702
I liked the old structure of my brain.

218
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,375
But then I liked
a lot of my old structures.

219
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,045
Well, these are positive changes.

220
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,844
Studies with rats show that new mothers
are more sensitive to danger,

221
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:13,173
better at multitasking
and bolder in the pursuit of food.

222
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,222
I did stick a couple
of lamb chops in my purse.

223
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,639
So that's what I was smelling.

224
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,186
Look, even though your brain
is different, in many ways it's better.

225
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:27,729
But were you bored?

226
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,105
Of course not.

227
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,315
You're lying.

228
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,368
Which you can tell
because your maternal brain

229
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,320
is better at sensing non-verbal cues.

230
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,368
Now you're just being condescending.

231
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,575
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Look at you, two-for-two.

232
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,462
LEONARD: Hold the door, hold the door.

233
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,094
Oh, hi, Leonard.

234
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,060
Didn't you hear me yell "hold the door"?

235
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:03,398
I did. But you know what they say,
"hold the door, get robbed some more."

236
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,522
No one says that.

237
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,855
Oh. Well, they should
because it's true and it rhymes.

238
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,987
So, where have you been?

239
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,240
Actually, I met Bill Gates.

240
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,494
(SIGHS)

241
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,245
I see, you're all in on it,
ah, nice try.

242
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:26,088
It's not an April Fools' joke, Sheldon.
I actually went to a hotel and met him.

243
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:32,215
Right, right. Okay, so, "Bill Gates"
was at the "hotel" that you "went to."

244
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,221
Why is "went to" in quotes?

245
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:41,307
Fine. So "Bill Gates" was at the "hotel"
that you went to.

246
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,640
That's you and Bill Gates.

247
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,058
It is.

248
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,568
- Were you crying?
- No.

249
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,904
So it wasn't a joke
and I actually could have met him?

250
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,611
He's probably still there.

251
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,116
(GASPS) What hotel?

252
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,744
The La Quinta Inn in Thousand Oaks
under the name Hernandez.

253
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,992
Thank you. Thank you so much.

254
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,537
April Fools.

255
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,713
(KEYS CLATTER)

256
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,339
- Hey.
- Hey. Where have you been?

257
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,095
Ah, just hanging out with the guys.

258
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,380
They still mad at me?

259
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,761
Uh, they were,
but then I was like, "Hey."

260
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,759
And they were like, "What?"
and I was like, "You know,"

261
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,095
and they were like, "Okay. "

262
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:26,894
You're a good husband.

263
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,105
Well, it's not for me to say but you
just said it so you're probably right.

264
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,400
Well, as it turns out,
there is a little reception

265
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,783
for Mr. Gates tomorrow night, I asked
if I could bring you and they said yes.

266
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:41,738
What?

267
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,371
Yeah, you get to meet Bill Gates again.

268
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,459
Wait, what do you mean again?

269
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,921
'Cause you met him
that one time with your mom.

270
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,247
Yes.

271
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:56,428
And then again tomorrow for
a total of two and only two times.

272
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,260
Yeah, I wonder if he'll remember you.

273
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,511
Yeah, I wonder that too.

274

Wow. Hop on Pop took
a dark turn there at the end.

282
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,756
Amy made me realize
that new mothers are cognitively primed

283
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,382
to take in new information,

284
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,557
and I've been wasting it
making up songs about our babies' toes.

285

To be fair I co-wrote
Pinky Toe Pinky Toe.

Evolution gave me this mom brain
to focus on the baby,

287
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,692
but I figure I can hack it
to learn all kinds of new things.

288
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,319
That's great.

289
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,901
Yeah, there was a problem
and I fixed it.

290
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,696

in that giraffe cage.

I didn't see that one yet.

you get to meet Bill Gates again.

293
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,667
It's not fun, I'm screwed.

294
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,091
It's fun for us. (CHUCKLES)

295
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,087
Maybe he won't remember you.

296
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,967
I snotted on his tie.

297
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,682
Yeah, you did, like a lot.

298
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,688
Hello, Leonard.
I thought I'd find you here.

299
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,723
You snake.

300
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,476
What's going on?

301
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,237
He sent me all the way to Thousand Oaks
to meet Bill Gates

302
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,106
when he knew full well
he wasn't staying there.

303
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,025
Leonard, that's terrible.

304
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,234
Yeah, why would you do that?

305
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,703
You know he's staying
at the Double Tree in Long Beach.

306
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,156
Ah-ha.

307
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,294
Wait, how do I know
you're not tricking me?

308
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,580
We probably are.
