00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:04,756
Can we start the movie?

2
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,924
Before Sheldon gets here?

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,601
Last time we did that, he didn't
talk to us for a month.

4
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,679
So do it!

5
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:13,939
Hold on. Where is he?

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,143
Well, according to his text,
he was on the second floor,

7
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,769
then he stopped
to tie his shoe.

8
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:20,896

- Hi.

11
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,912
Sorry we're late.
Amy took forever tying my shoe.

12
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:34,035
All right!
Who's excited to see a documentary?

13
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,085
Oh, I know this one.
Nobody ever.

14
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,255
Hey! This one's
going to be great.

15
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,582
This is about the rivalry

16
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,214
between a cool renegade
scientist, Nikola Tesla,

17
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,169
and his arch-nemesis,
Thomas Edison.

18
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,506
And it's the greatest
scientific feud of all time.

19
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,341
I mean, you can forget
about Leibniz and Newton.

20
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:50,555
Done.

21
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:54,229
So, Tesla's the one
that invented the electric car?

22
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,727
(ALL LAUGHING)

23
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,811
No, Penny.
No, the car is just named after him.

24
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,729
Okay, you don't have to be
so smug about it.

25
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,064
You know, you went
to see the movie <i>It</i>

26
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,774
because you thought
it was about scary l.T. guys.

27
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,413
Tesla was a genius who
invented our electrical grid.

28
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,331
Edison just wanted to
get rich and famous.

29
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,909
Didn't he invent the light bulb?

30
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,201
Mmm, that's what
he wants you to think.

31
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,788
But without the foundational
work of Ebenezer Kinnersley,

32
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,293
Warren de la Rue
and James Bowman Lindsay,

33
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,421
you wouldn't know Edison
any more than you know

34
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,674
Ebenezer Kinnersley, Warren de la Rue
or James Bowman Lindsay.

35
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,924
Isn't he sexy all fired up?

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,053
He really gets my current alternating,
if you know what I mean.

37
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,689
Edison was kind of a
publicity hog and a bully.

38
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,858
Yeah, he electrocuted
an elephant named Topsy

39
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,606
just to make himself famous.

40
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,108
If I had an elephant named Topsy,
he would want for nothing.

41
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,237
Also, he'd be named Jumbo.

42
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,703
And worse than that, Edison
filmed the first on-screen kiss,

43
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,164
<i>so</i> he's basically
a pornographer.

44
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,493
Although every time
I put that in Wikipedia,

45
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,419
someone takes it out.

46
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,419
Is your current still alternating?

47
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,842
We're lucky there aren't
any elephants in here.

48
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,339
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

49
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,240
You know, that documentary
last night was actually

50
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,825
better than I
thought it would be.

51
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:38,955
Really?

52
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,331
Should've been about
Samuel Morse

53
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,458
the way they telegraphed
that ending.

54
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,128
You know, I already pretended to laugh
at that joke once.

55
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,754
Do I have to do it again?

56
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,594
Yeah, I'd appreciate it. (CHUCKLES)

drive me to work?

Yeah, sure.
Hey, the guys and I

60

Oh, I'm sorry, I can't.
I'm busy.

- Why? What are you doing?
- Leonard, what are you doing?

64

He said he can't go.
Make a sad face, move on.

65

It's fine.
I couldn't tell you even if I wanted to.

66

- What does that mean?
- Leonard!

67

Sad face, sad face.

I mean, I would like to,
but ljust can't, you know,

69

Hold on, are you still
working for the military?

71

I'm so glad
you figured that out!

72

74

They did,
but then they hired me back.

75

Well, you better not be
working on our project,

because we're a team.

Leonard, there is
no "I" in team.

78

However, there is an "I" in

"I'm working with the military
and you're not."

00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,829
You're just saying that
'cause she's sleeping with you.

158
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,824
Yes, that's my favorite charity.

159
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:34,379
I know I sound paranoid,
but I'm feeling really vulnerable.

160
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,752
If there's anything you could
find out, it'd be great.

161
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,635
And if she is up to anything,
what are you gonna do?

162
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,258
Nothing.

163
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,006
I'll just calmly
talk to her and explain

164
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,512
there are certain boundaries
that need to be respected.

165
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:50,016
It's really for the benefit
of everyone at the company.

166
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,642
Ah. Okay, what you're saying
sounds nice,

167
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,227
but the way you're saying it

168
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,655
is causing my testicles
to take cover in my abdomen.

169
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,285
What do you want to watch?

170
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,820
Oh, why don't you pick?

171
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,785
Okay, how about comedy?

172
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,583
Eh, I already laughed today.

173
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,878
I know. It was when I stubbed my toe.

174
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,622
(CHUCKLES) Still funny.

175
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:19,958
Drama?

176
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,884
Nah, I've already seen
someone cry today.

177
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,678
It really hurt, Sheldon!

178
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,971
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

179
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,721
Hey. We talked to Colonel Williams.

180
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,801
He told us everything.

181
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,431
I'm sorry, can we do this
another time?

182
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,936
Amy's just about to realize she
wants to watch a Hulk marathon.

183
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,058
What's going on?

184
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,941
Sheldon went to the Air Force
behind our backs.

185
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,567
I did nothing of the sort.

186
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,027
I had an idea

187
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,200
for a neutrino-based
communication system,

188
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,369
I presented it to them,
and they were interested.

189
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,287
But your communication system

190
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,364
was based on our guidance system.

191
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,621
And sonar is based on bats.

192
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,122
You don't see them
hanging upside down

193
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,249
in a patent attorney's office.

194
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,587
You know what, you like to think
that you're just like Tesla,

195
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,963
but the truth is
you're exactly like Edison.

196
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,217
- You take that back.
- No, he's right.

197
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,971
You are a bully, a credit hog
and a self-promoter.

198
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,806
And if anyone around here
is like Tesla, it's us.

199
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,729
Yeah.

200
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,447
Can you believe they said
I was just like Edison?

201
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,150
Yeah, and in front of a lady, no less.

202
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,323
Well, you are
building on their work

203
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,908
and taking the credit for it.

204
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,614
That's a classic Edison move.

205
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,157
Oh, yeah?

206
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,368
Well, if I'm Edison
and you love me,

207
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,044
then what does that say
about you?

208
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,957
- I honestly don't know.
- Okay.

209
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,293
Well, I have to google
some stuff about Mrs. Edison.

210
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,548
I'll be right back.

211
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,971
You know whose fault this is?

212
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,224
I do. Yours.

213
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,765
No, my mother's.

214
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,849
"Go make friends, Sheldon."

215
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,108
What happens?
Twenty years later, they call me names.

216
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,195
I don't think what they
called you is the point here.

217
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,026
Oh, yeah? How would you feel

218
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,284
if I called you the name of a
neuroscientist you didn't like?

219
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,824
Do you know the name
of any neuroscientist?

220
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,288
Of course.

221
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,618
Not me?

222
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,413
Then no.

223
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,924
Do you think they're right, Amy?

224
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,511
Do you think I'm like Edison?

225
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,591
Sheldon, I don't think you're upset

226
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,769
because of what kind of
scientist they said you're like.

227
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,355
I think you're upset because
your friends' feelings got hurt.

228
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,692
You're right.

229
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,190
I care too much about
other people's feelings.

230
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,653
It's always been my fatal flaw.

231
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,443
Sheldon, I don't think--

232
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,076
No, no, not now, Amy.
I'm growing as a person.

233
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,626
That was fun.

234
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,579
Put her there, buddy.

235
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,629
lam not fist bumping
you after we have sex.

236
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,339
You're the one who wanted
to keep things casual.

237
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,922
There's a difference
between casual and weird.

238
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,931
Not the way I do it.

239
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,512
So, how was your day?

240
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,724
Like, how's work?

241
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,726
Oh, great. With Bernadette gone,

242
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,982
I'm getting to handle all her projects.

243
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,149
Well, she's not gone.
She'll be back soon.

244
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,159
Not too soon, let's hope.

245
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,159
So it turns out Ruchi is totally

246
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,865
trying to take over
Bernadette's projects.

247
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,950
Wow, she just told you
that out of the blue?

248
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,752
Yeah, yeah,
we had just made love.

249
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,500
It was so beautiful.

250
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,252
Our caramel-colored bodies

251
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,005
were entwined like erotic taffy--

252
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,835
Get to the point!

253
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,171
Sorry, yeah.

254
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,598
(STAMMERING) I asked her about work,
and she just admitted

255
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,641
she has her eyes
on Bernadette's projects.

256
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:58,934
Can't believe she
would take advantage

257
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,308
of a pregnant lady like that.
So what did you do?

258
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,764
What do you think I did?

259
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,726
I made small talk for 20 minutes
and had sex again.

260
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,315
You have to say
something to Bernie.

261
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,817
I don't know. If I do that,
she's gonna confront Ruchi,

262
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,649
and then Ruchi's gonna
stop sleeping with me.

263
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,359
Raj, you can't go on
sleeping with a woman

264
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,160
who's trying to screw
over your friend.

265
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,951
Can't or must?

266
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,876
You know, that guidance system
was my idea.

267
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,169
You figured out how to make it work.

268
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,542
We didn't even need Sheldon.

269
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,582
Let's not forget your idea
was based on my theory.

270
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,886
Hey, we're bagging
on Sheldon here! Focus!

271
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,219
I guess it was pretty smart
using our quantum technology

272
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,221
as the basis for
a communication system.

273
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,186
Be even better if he swapped out
the helium for xenon.

274
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,020
Ooh, so instead of having to
keep it at negative 271 degrees,

275
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,101
you'd only have to keep it
at negative 108.

276
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,481
It would be way more efficient.

277
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,608
And xenon has a bigger nucleus,

278
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:54,282
<i>so</i> coherence would make it
an easier signal to see.

279
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,608
You're brilliant!

280
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,945
- We should tell Sheldon.
- You're an idiot!

281
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,242
We don't tell Sheldon.

282
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,789
We go to the military
behind his back

283
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,616
and we screw him
like he screwed us.

284
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,247
Yeah, yeah. All right, you're right,
you're right, we don't need him.

285
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,418
We can do this all on our own.

286
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,537
Do you think
you can do the math?

287
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,872
No.

288
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:11,799
But if someone else does it,

289
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,922
I can double check
the crap out of it.

290
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,470
I want you to know,
I did what you asked.

291
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,518
I talked to Ruchi and found out
what's going on at work.

292
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,470
So, is she trying
to steal my projects?

293
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,227
No, not trying to,
sounds like it's a done deal.

294
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,398
Here, have a brownie.

295
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,777
- L'm gonna kill her.
- Okay, don't take this out on Ruchi.

296
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,863
Is she trying to take your job? Yes.

297
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,690
Is she parking in your space? Yes.

298
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,241
Did she get a laugh
at a meeting yesterday

299
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,411
by calling you "Pregnadette"?
Big one.

300
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,374
But you would've done the exact
same thing and you know it.

301
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,372
I never would've
undermined a coworker.

302
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,375
What? Oh, please.
What about that guy Eric

303
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,707
who you told it was
"Bring Your Cat to Work Day"

304
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,417
when you knew
your boss had asthma?

305
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,878
That was just a hilarious prank

306
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,089
that ended with me
getting a corner office.

307
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,175
All I'm saying is

308
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,431
before you attack Ruchi,
maybe you should

309
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,887
take a long hard look
in the mirror,

310
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,187
because you know what you'll see,

311
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,149
apart from radiant skin
and luxuriously thick hair?

312
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,726
Hypocrisy!

313
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,824
It is thick.

314
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,446
So what do you think?
Can you make it work?

315
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,657
Uh, ljust need to use the cross section

316
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,118
to calculate the probability
of the interaction.

317
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,706
Can we help?

318
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,038
Yes.

319
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,373
Why don't you run
get me a can of Pringles.

320
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,256
Leonard, I was--

321
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,341
What's Kripke doing here?

322
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,718
He's just helping us
develop a better, more efficient

323
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,017
neutrino comm system that we're
gonna pitch to the military,

324
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,184
making yours obsolete.

325
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,260
Yeah, Leonard thought of it.

326
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,596
- It's genius.
- Thanks.

327
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,271
You see, instead of
using liquid helium...

328
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,566
- Good God, man, shut up!
- Right, sorry.

329
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,727
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

330
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,939
You didn't tell me we were doing this
just to stick it to Sheldon.

331
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,274
- Oh, well...
-l'm messing with you.

332
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,655
This sundae just got a cherry on top!

333
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,905
Fine. Good luck to you.

334
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,332
The military is already
interested in my system,

335
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,660
and my math is worked out.

336
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,335
His still has a big gap in it.

337
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,296
Where?

338
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,831
- There.
- What?

339
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,470
- Can I ask you a question?
- Hmm?

340
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,881
Does a drug still count
as an antidepressant

341
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:27,344
if its number one side effect
is uncontrollable weeping?

342
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:32,060
I don't know. I always feel
better after a good cry.

343
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,315
I've been trying to ask Bernadette,
but she's not answering any of my texts.

344
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,984
Yeah, listen, I think she might be

345
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,815
a little threatened by you, you know,

346
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,321
because you can tie your own
shoes and laugh without peeing.

347
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,158
Did she say something to you?

348
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,580
No.

349
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,282
I mean, well, kind of.

350
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,242
But it's okay. She's just hormonal.

351
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,998
And, you know, don't worry,
I stood up for you.

352
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,496
I don't need you to stand up for me.

353
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,877
You're not my boyfriend.

354
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,049
Look, I care about you,

355
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,628
and you can say that
this doesn't mean anything,

356
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,839
but the truth is we're in
a relationship, okay?

357
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,595
And you're gonna have to figure
out some way to deal with it.

358
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,136
I can't believe she dumped me.

359
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,894
This is tough for me, 'cause I can.

360
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,447
Sorry things worked out like that.

361
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,530
Because I'm in pain or because
you don't have a spy anymore?

362
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,531
Let's just leave it at, "I'm sorry."

363
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,703
You're already sad.

364
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,415
Based on Kripke's calculations,
I think this is gonna work.

365
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,337
Maybe we should pitch it
to Colonel Williams today.

366
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,539
Why limit ourselves
to the U.S. Military?

367
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,172
I bet there's a lot of
other places we could take this.

368
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,378
Without committing criminal espionage?

369
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,634
You know, it's easy
to shoot an idea down, Leonard.

370
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,886
Well, I suppose
congratulations are in order.

371
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,892
You set out to destroy me,
and you achieved your goal.

372
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,018
What are you talking about?

373
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,351
The military canceled my project,
because they're going with yours.

374
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,730
That's impossible.
We haven't even pitched it yet.

375
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,906
Well, Colonel Williams said
another team at Caltech

376
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,109
came up with a more efficient
neutrino comm system.

377
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,409
Damn it!

378
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,868
Excuse us.

379
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:12,873
Kripke.

380
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,169
- What's up, fellas?
- Did you screw us over?

381
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,334
Ooh, I can't tell you that.
It's classified.

382
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,965
Why did you tell
Barry Kripke your idea?

383
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,265
This is all your fault.

384
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:31,763
No, it's your fault.

385
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,185
If you would've come to us
in the beginning,

386
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,478
None of this would've happened.

387
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,602
Well, if it helps,
you all behaved terribly

388
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,228
and you deserve what you got.

389
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,226
Well, that doesn't help at all.

390
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,984
You know, sometimes your
social skills are very poor.

391
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:49,236
I can't believe we let
Kripke use us like that.

392
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,491
You know, maybe you're all
more like the guy

393
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,949
who didn't invent the electric car

394
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,410
and less like the guy
who didn't invent the light bulb.

395
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,130
She's right. Maybe we're all
a bunch of Teslas after all.

396
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,422
Didn't Tesla die penniless,
forgotten and insane?

397
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,475
(SIGHS) You may have a point
about her social skills.

398
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,181
He wasn't insane.

399
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,059
He did fall in love with a pigeon.

400
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,973
Well, if we're gonna
call Tesla crazy

401
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,808
for loving something
small and unappealing,

402
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,189
might as well put Penny
in a padded cell right now.
