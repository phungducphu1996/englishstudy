<i>Are we looking beyond,
or are we looking within?</i>

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,388
(EXHALES) I'm looking at my shoes.

4
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,519
This is making me a
little motion sick.

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,527
<i>When we gaze out
at the immensities of space,</i>

6
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,900
<i>we understand them

7
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,981

00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,786

for taking a walk with me</i>

11
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,169
That pause gets
longer every show.

12
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:37,838
I believe

13
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,790
you're right.

14
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,425
Hey. Can I get a picture with you?

15
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:43,795
Absolutely.

16
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,546
And if you post it on social media,

17
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,757
I suggest the hashtag "Koothra-poet."

18
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:50,301
Thank you.
The show was great.

19
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,636
Well, I can't take all the credit.

20
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,561
I have pretty good co-stars.

21
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,935
The stars.

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,685
Do you say that to everyone?

23
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,270
Only to beautiful women.

24
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,359
And okay women.

25
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,232
Okay.

26
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,363
Just to clarify,
you're the first kind.

27
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,236
Okay.

28
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,954
Mmm.

29
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:14,367
Thanks for coming. What did you handsome
gentlemen think of the show?

30
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,955
You can turn it off now.

31
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,455
It's sweet of you to say,
but I don't think I can.

32
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,625
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

33
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,740
Look at this cute picture
of Halley in the bath.

34
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,366
(LAUGHS) That's great.

35
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,493
Want me to send it to you?

36
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,371
No, on your phone it's cute,
on my phone it's a crime.

37
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,046
I also have
a pretty cute picture to share.

38
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,753
What is that?

39
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,797
An equation.

40
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,377
Isn't it perfect?

41
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,883
Sometimes ljust stare at it,

42
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,260
and I think, "I can't believe
that came out of me."

43
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:13,847
Well, since we're sharing pictures,

44
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,472
I have one to contribute.

45
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:18,564
Please don't let it be
you and your dog in the bathtub.

46
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,056
It's not.

47
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,109
But don't swipe.

48
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:25,942
What are we looking at here?

49
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,524
Well, that's me and a beautiful woman

50
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,907
and my watch showing the time
as 2:30 in the morning.

51
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,039
So, state's exhibit "A"?

52
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,542
No. I met her at
the planetarium a few days ago,

53
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,871
and she invited me out for a drink.

54
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,832
Oh. Good for you.
And what's the Hindi word for "dog"?

55
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,792
<i>- A kutta .
- You kutta.</i>

56
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,051
<i>Bow-bow.</i>

57
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,093
That's Hindi for woof-woof.

58
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,267
I am seeing her again tonight.

59
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,470
You know, I also have a date tonight.

60
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,429
But don't worry,
it's not another woman.

61
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,473
It's string theory.

62
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,101
<i>Bow-bow.</i>

63
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,693
Sorry, he's a kutta, you're not.

64
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,074
- Hi.
- Hello.

65
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,363
What you doing?

66
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,412
Taking another picture with my baby.

67
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,332
Look how big he got.

68
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,456
It's fun to see you this excited.

69
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,961
Thank you, that's so--

70
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,967
- Don't sit there!
- What, what?

71
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,670
Sorry. It's part
of my organization system.

72
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,596
That's where those papers go.

73
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:37,434
Okay. How about if I just

74
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,935
slide this notebook--

75
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,313
(EXCLAIMS)

76
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,189
You know what, it's fine.
I'll just be in the bedroom.

77
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,893
No, no. This is your apartment, too.

78
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,439
Look, I'll stop for the night

79
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,813
and clean this up.

80
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,072
Well, that's very considerate, Sheldon.

81
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,525
I know.

82
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,326
See, I'm trying this new technique

83
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,450
where I imagine how I would feel
in someone else's position.

84
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,539
You mean empathy?

85
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,787
Aw, I thought I came up with it.

86
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,212
Well, regardless,
I appreciate the effort.

87
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,915
Thank you.
It's really hard.

88
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,716
- Morning.
- Good morning.

89
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,594
Aw, you didn't have
to cook me breakfast.

90
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,471
Well, I wasn't sure
how I did last night,

91
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,143
and I wanted to finish strong.

92
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,100
You don't need to worry.

93
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,181
Last night was great.

94
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,976
Ah, well, you say that now,

95
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:31,488
but wait until you taste this.

96
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,946
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

97
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,531
Which is why I keep an omelet
pan in the trunk of my car.

98
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,953
Well, thank you,
it's delicious.

99
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,080
My husband never cooked for me.

100
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,829
Oh. You were married.

101
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:50,462
Yeah. Well, technically,
I guess I still am.

102
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,385
Is that "technically,"

103
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,133
like, the paperwork hasn't gone through,

104
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,465
or "technically,"

105
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,300
like, he's in the closet
watching us right now?

106
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,180
No, no, we're separated.

107
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,893
Do you mind if we talk
about something else?

108
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,144
Of course.

109
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,395
You know, my secret to
making great omelets is that

110
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,730
I beat the egg whites separately.

111
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,236
Speaking of which,
how long have you been separated?

112
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,402
About two weeks.

113
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,455
That is not a lot of weeks.

114
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:26,293
In fact, that's the bare minimum
to get to the plural "weeks."

115
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,547
Doesn't matter.
He moved out, I moved on.

116
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,040
Good.

117
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,046
Yeah, do you mind me asking
what he does for a living?

118
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,297
He's a firefighter.

119
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,470
Interesting.

120
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,636
A potentially jealous man
who's handy with an ax.

121
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,473
(LAUGHS) It's okay, though.

122
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,055
He's almost had two weeks to cool down.

123
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,568
Okay, the next drug is Romatrol.

124
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,645
Oh, I know this one. We're actually
pushing it really hard.

125
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,526
It treats mild dermatitis.

126
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,903
Correct. And who can it
be prescribed to?

127
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:01,032
Adults and children
who have absolutely, for sure,

128
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,704
stopped growing.

129
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,328
Right again.
And what are the side effects?

130
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,084
Oh. Shoot, shoot.

131
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,411
Remember the mnemonic.

132
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,788
Gravy. Yes. G-R-A-V-Y.

133
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,251
Okay, gastric distress,
redness, anal leakage,

134
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,963
vasculitis and yellow eyes.

135
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,006
So close.

136
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,717
- It's actually yellow discharge.
- Oh. Right.

137
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,640
That's why we went with "gravy."

138
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,480
Hello.

139
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,773
- Hey.
- Hi.

140
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,361
He knows he doesn't
live here anymore, right?

141
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:43,196
Maybe he's experiencing
memory loss because he took...

142
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,493
- Flaxitrite.
- Yeah.

143
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,325
- Thank you.
- Sheldon, what are you doing?

144
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,627
Oh, I was just checking in
on my old room

145
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,124
to see what you've done with it.

146
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,584
Why?

147
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,633
Well, I could use a place
to work in the evenings--

148
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,460
- No.
- Well, it's just that

149
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,590
there's not a lot of space in our

150
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,761
-apartment--
- No.

151
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,838
Well, and I feel like

152
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,014
- Amy's been having--
- No.

153
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,513
- And since you're not--
- No.

154
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,011
- It's--
- No.

155
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,143
No.

156
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,148
That is our room now,
and we're gonna turn it into a gym.

157
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,069
Do you really expect me
to believe that?

158
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,898
- No.
- No.

159
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,027
So I guess what's bugging me

160
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,952
is that they only broke up
13 days ago,

161
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,200
and now I'm dating her.

162
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,077
So, am I, like,
the good guy in my movie,

163
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,578
or the bad guy in their movie?

164
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,623
Pretty sure you're
the weird friend in our movie.

165
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,081
(SIGHS) I like her, okay?

166
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,383
ljust, I don't know how I feel about
being the third wheel in a relationship.

167
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,086
Says the guy in my bed with my wife.

168
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,597
Guys, I mean, he's around, okay?

169
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,516
He's apparently not happy
about the breakup,

170
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,468
and based on the sweatpants
he left at her place,

171
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,724
he's like, a medium to large man.

172
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,316
Maybe those are
his "after the holiday" pants,

173
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,893
like you have.

174
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,564
I don't know. I mean, do you think
it's too soon for her to be dating?

175
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:00,989
If you and Bernadette broke up,

176
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,407
like, how long would you wait?

177
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,985
- Well, I don't even want to think--
- Eight days.

178
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,404
What?

179
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,161
Two days to cry.
Six days to hit the gym.

180
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,955
First of all, you already look amazing.

181
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,536
Aw, that's sweet.

182
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,043
I'm gonna give him
an extra day of crying.

183
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,960
The answer is still no.

184
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:28,638
You can say we wouldn't know
you're here, but we'd know.

185
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,144
Because you'd be here!

186
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,350
So, who was that?

187
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,193
I can't believe you hung up on me!

188
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,571
What the hell?
What are you doing here?

189
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,159
lam proving you wrong.

190
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,702
I've been working
back there for hours.

191
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,279
You had no idea.

192
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,244
(STUTTERS) Do something.

193
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,075
What the hell?
What are you doing here?

194
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,707
I am trying to respect Amy.

195
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,084
Okay, look, you have an office at work.
Why don't you go there?

196
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,713
I can't go to the office
every time I have a brilliant thought.

197
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,963
I'd basically be living there.

198
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,920
Sounds good, do that.

199
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,384
No. No, the campus
isn't safe at night.

200
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,717
There's raccoons and
undergrads just walking around

201
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,301
like they own the place.

202
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,596
Look. I need somewhere
to work in the evenings.

203
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,226
You have a space you aren't using.

204
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,276
Just take a look at my proposal.

205
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,518
(SIGHS)

206
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,604
- What is this?
- A rental agreement.

207
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,485
I will only use the room for work.

208
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,362
I won't sleep here,
I won't eat your food,

209
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,784
I won't even use your bathroom.

210
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,658
So you can just walk in any
time of the day or night?

211
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,909
Well, he does that now.

212
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,956
At least this way we'll get paid.

213
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,545
<i>I am Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,</i>

214
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,464
<i>and thank you
for taking a walk with me</i>

215
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,636
<i>through the stars.</i>

216
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,674
I think that one was too long.

217
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,722
Yeah, you're right.
I totally felt it.

218
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,053
Should we run it again?

219
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,100
Please, God, no.

220
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,766
- Hey
- Hey

221
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,020
Can I help you?

222
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,569
Which one of you is Rajesh Koothrappali?

223
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,275
Really? You're not sure

224
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,823
which one of us is Rajesh Koothrappali?

225
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,453
I am. I was just trying
not to be racist.

226
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,787
I'm Nell's husband.

227
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,335
(STAMMERS)
Here's the thing, I didn't know

228
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,382
that she was married until after--

229
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,801
After what?

230
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,182
I'm really sorry.

231
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,142
Well, that doesn't make me feel better.

232
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,769
What would make you feel better?

233
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,313
I want you to stop seeing my wife.

234
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,061
Done.
Nice to meet you. Bye.

235
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,478
What am I gonna do?

236
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:45,687
(SOBBING)

237
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,109
(INAUDIBLE)

238
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,288
Hey, buddy, do you want to talk?

239
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,412
I thought we were gonna start a family.

240
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,287
Next thing I know, it's over.

241
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,961
It's gonna be okay.

242
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,295
How is it gonna be okay?

243
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,718
You're sleeping with my wife.

244
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,589
I mean, besides that.

245
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,311
Can I get you anything?

246
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,859
A glass of water?

247
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,606
A laser show?

248
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,779
- No, thank you.
- Good.

249
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,278
'Cause I don't even know
how to turn it on.

250
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,401
I'm sorry.

251
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,369
I shouldn't have come here.

252
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,703
I guess ljust wanted to see
who she replaced me with.

253
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,954
Don't say that.

254
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,661
What you two had was special.

255
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,417
No one can replace you.

256
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,170
- Did she say that?
- No.

257
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:50,969
- I should go, right?
- Stay.

258
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,842
Okay, I'll call you later.

259
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,802
Look, if it makes you feel any better,
I barely know her.

260
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,688
And she had sex with you?

261
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,726
Nell tells me you're a fireman.
What's that like?

262
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:18,197
Okay, I'm really uncomfortable
with him back in that room.

263
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,036
Why? He hasn't made a peep all day.

264
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,958
You don't get it.
All the years that we lived together,

265
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,036
he drove me crazy the whole time.

266
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,334
And now he's not.

267
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,961
Exactly.

268
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,385
Don't look at me like that.

269
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,054
It means he did it on purpose.

270
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,506
It was a choice.

271
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,559
That's like finding out
Godzilla could've had Arby's

272
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,432
instead of Tokyo.

273
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,726
I don't think they have Arby's in Japan.

274
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,308
Not my point.

275
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,195
Sheldon.

276
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,739
Sheldon!

277
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,492
I'm sorry. Am I being too loud?

278
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,321
No, you're being perfect
and you know it.

279
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,625
Would you like me to be a
less considerate tenant?

280
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,081
No. Yes. What--

281
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,295
Stop messing with me!

282
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:14,427
Hey, I was wrong.
There's an Arby's in Okinawa.

283
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,680
He was best friends
with her older brother,

284
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,011
but he didn't even notice her.

285
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,141
And then years afterward,

286
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,723
they randomly bumped into
each other at the DMV.

287
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,059
Two hours later,
they were in love.

288
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,445
You can really see the sparkle
in his license photo.

289
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,735
He told you all this at the planetarium?

290
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,192
No, no, we went to House of Pies.

291
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,822
He got banana cream.
I got coconut.

292
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,494
We did halfsies.

293
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,119
You did pie halfsies with another man?
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

294
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,409
You mean other than you?

295
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,163
Yeah.

296
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,501
I feel bad for him, Bernie.
He's a good guy.

297
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,386
Well, if you're uncomfortable with it,
maybe stop sleeping with his wife.

298
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,839
I don't think the sex is the problem.

299
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,344
I know for a fact I was just okay.

300
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,854
For the record, I'm the one
who introduced you to House of Pies.

301
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,651
Sheldon? Oh, Leonard.

302
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,946
Sorry, ljust, I had
to get out of there.

303
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,189
What did he do now?

304
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,570
Nothing. He's being a dream.

305
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,575
Don't give me that look. That's how
Penny looked at me. I'm not crazy.

306
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,664
Penny and I have the same
"You're crazy" look?

307
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,162
That's kind of sweet.

308
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,042
I know how to deal with
Sheldon being Sheldon,

309
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,374
but Sheldon being a rational,
thoughtful person?

310
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,004
I'm clueless.

311
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,587
It's like when my mom called last year
to sing happy birthday

312
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,297
and I just threw up.

313
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,717
Well, if it gets to be too much,

314
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,677
you can always send him back over here.

315
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,852
I made a deal with him,

316
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,555
and besides,
that wouldn't be fair to you.

317
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,353
Well, actually, I miss him.
He's been over there a lot.

318
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,852
Well, great.
Tell him he can come back.

319
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,233
I can't. He's thinking of me
and my feelings

320
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,689
and trying to be respectful.

321
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,696
That's what he's doing
to me, too, the jerk!

322
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,410
Stop that.

323
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,082
Hey, your mad look and Sheldon's
constipated look are the same.

324
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,126
- This is nice.
- It is.

325
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,805
She used to kiss me like that.

326
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,804
You Okay?

327
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,725
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.

328
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,647
Yeah.

329
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,393
Oh, God, I'm so alone.

330
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,145
Sorry, I can't do this.

331
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,113
What's going on?

332
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,695
I met Oliver the other day.

333
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,985
Wait, you tracked down my husband?

334
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,654
(SIGHS) No, that would be weird.

335
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,452
He tracked me down,
then we spent the evening together.

336
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,159
I don't believe this.

337
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,378
He only did it
because he cares about you.

338
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,549
No, he did it because
he's possessive and jealous.

339
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,843
Really? I didn't get that at all.
He made me feel very comfortable.

340
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,801
Well, I'm glad you two hit it off.

341
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,050
You know, I don't think that
you're being very fair to him.

342
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,969
You're taking his side?

343
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,349
No, but I should point out
that he did offer

344
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:14,023
to go to counseling,
so at least one of you is trying.

345
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,855
You're crazier than he is.

346
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,154
I'll tell you what,
just give him one more chance

347
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,355
and if it doesn't work out,

348
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,734
I'll be happy to keep
sleeping with you.

349
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,658
You would?

350
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,577
Either way, you've got yourself a fella.

351
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,829
Like, how nice is that?

352
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,082
Hey, Sheldon.

353
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,219
- Hello.
- Hey.

354
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,298
So, your contract provides
for a three-day trial period,

355
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,803
and I don't think this is working out.

356
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,430
So, to put it in legal terms,

357
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,599
the party of the first part would like

358
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,272
the party of the second part to get out.

359
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,318
What time does the trial period end?

360
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,565
12:00, noon.

361
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,319
Yeah, what does it say after that?

362
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,533
Eastern Standard Time.

363
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,578
That was three hours ago.

364
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,458
And since you didn't exercise

365
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:18,755
your right to revoke,
I exercised my right to extend,

366
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:23,300
triggering this long-form
rental agreement,

367
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,967
of which you're already in violation.

368
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,261
This is just a bunch of paper.

369
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,887
You can't enforce this.

370
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,261
Hire a lawyer.
Let's find out.

371
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:36,723
This is not happening.

Be that as it may,

373

you have to provide me

00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,858
with lemon-flavored sparkling
water, so, chop-chop.

375
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,284
Hey, how'd it go?

376
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,579
Well, apparently he's not leaving,

377
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:54,248
and I have to go get him
sparkling water.

378
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,243
Why are you smiling?

379
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:00,372
I don't know. It just feels right.

Hey, buddy.

384
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,933
I talked to Nell.

385
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,940
She was pretty upset after you left.

386
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,568
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- No. No, no, no.

387
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,694
She told me that you said
something so creepy

388
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,117
that I seemed great in comparison.

389
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,824
I know exactly what it was.

390
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,780
No, actually, there was
a couple of things it could've been.

391
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,413
Whichever one it was,
it was creepy.

392
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,919
Anyway, I went over to comfort her,

393
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:43,589

gonna give it another chance.
