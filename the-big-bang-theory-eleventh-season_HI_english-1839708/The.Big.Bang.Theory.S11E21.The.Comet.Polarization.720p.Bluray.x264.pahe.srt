1
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:07,508
What're you doing?

2
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,385
Pigeon check for Sheldon.

3
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,562
North side's all clear.

4
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,390
Great. Let's look at some planets.

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,189
Hey, Why'd you lug your telescope
all the way over here?

6
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,485
Leonard has one in our apartment.

7
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,154
(SARCASTICALLY) Yeah, I'm gonna
use Leonard's.

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,074
Might as well hold my hand up like this
and squint.

9
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,287
I don't know, it seemed pretty good.

10
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,454
You know, once when the cable went out

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,702
I watched an entire episode of

12
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,954
The Bachelor on the TV
across the street.

13
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,127
This one's more of a professional model.

14
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,546
So was the girl he picked!

15
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:43,302
This baby's got a 10-inch diameter
with F-10 ACF optics.

16
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,881
And tonight,
Mercury is at its highest elongation.

17
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:51,765
It makes far away things seem close,
and Mercury is a planet.

18
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:57,399
I know Mercury is a planet.
But the other thing was helpful.

19
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,896
Oh, look at that.
Neil Gaiman tweeted about my store.

20
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,196
What did he say?

21
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:06,025
"Next time you're in Pasadena,
check out The Comic Center.

22
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:09,738
"Great vibe, old school,
the owner really knows his stuff."

23
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,992
Isn't that amazing?

24
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,948
Well, it's no Sandman

25
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,955
but I guess we can't expect everything
he writes to be a masterpiece.

26
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,162
When was he in your store?

27
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,748
I have no idea.
I think I would remember that.

28
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,877
Obviously vibranium
is the most powerful metal in comics.

29
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,254
More powerful than adamantium?

30
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:32,093
Mmm. He's right, Wolverine's claws,
Ultron's outer shell, need I go on?

31
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,644
You don't need to,
but you probably will.

32
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,561
What about Wonder Woman's bracelets?

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,861
Good point. Strong as a metal
and fierce as a fashion choice.

34
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,361
You know,
Thor's hammer is pretty powerful,

35
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,034
and in the comics
it's made out of enchanted uru.

36
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,533
Yeah. I think it's the enchantment
that's powerful

37
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,162
and not the Uru, but thanks for playing.

38
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,164
Oh, man! I can't believe Neil Gaiman
came in and we weren't even there.

39
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,248
No.

40
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,001
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

41
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:31,906
Can you see Mercury? Can you see it?

42
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,325
One second.

43
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,699
You know the
Greek version of Mercury, Hermes,

44
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:41,458
was worshiped in Athens by the
carving of giant wooden phalluses.

45
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,841
Please, Amy, get your mind
out of the ancient Athenian gutter.

46
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,590
Got another follower, I'm blowing up.

47
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,424
- Great, how many does that make?
- High double digits.

48
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,726
- The nineties?
- Mid double digits.

49
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,979
Hey, uh, Penny,
you wanna check this out?

50
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,055
Yeah. Sure.

51
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,560
All right. Just look through here

52
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,358
and if you wanna take a picture
just push that button.

53
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,903
Okay. Oh, what is that?

54
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,980
Is it Mercury?
I'm really jonesing for Mercury.

55
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,365
I think it's a little early
for Mercury to be visible yet.

56
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,538
Playing hard to get.
I like that in a planet.

57
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,413
No, there's something fuzzy.

58
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,460
Is it your teen years?

59
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:29,673
No. Yes. Shut up. Look, I--
No really, I think I see something.

60
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,003
Well, it could just be your eyelash.

61
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,338
It's not an eyelash.

62
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,515
Okay, well, take a picture. Let's see.

63
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,432
Okay. Here.

64
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:41,805
Hmm.

65
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,940
- I do see something.
- Told ya.

66
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:47,940
- What is it?
- I don't know. Maybe it's a comet.

67
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,897
That would be so cool.

68
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,075
You guys wanna see a real star,
look over here.

69
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,151
What?

70
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,239
I just got retweeted by
Patton 0swalt's brother.

71
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,288
So, this is really
where Neil Gaiman shops?

72
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,630
Neil Gaiman, Nicholas Cage,
Natalie Portman, the list goes on.

73
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,548
They all come here?

74
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,047
Unless I'm lying.

75
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,815
Who are all these people?
What- Wait is this a flash mob?

76
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,155
Are they dancing?

77
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,525
I don't know what
today's dancing looks like.

78
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,368
Hey, guys. That tweet actually
got people to come in. Isn't that great?

79
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,249
No. I like the way the store was before.

80
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,456
You mean empty and sad?

81
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,414
Yes, it was perfect.

82
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,092
Like a funeral home
that sells Pokemon cards.

83
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,056
What am I supposed to do now if
I wanna hang out and read a <i>comic</i> book?

84
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,591
Go sit on the couch.

85
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,345
A... Next to a stranger?

86
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,815
I say, if I'm gonna sit,
read and ignore a woman,

87
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,187
it's gonna be my fiancée.

88
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,520
Why're you being such a baby
about the crowds?

89
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,604
You go to Comic Con.

90
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,987
You- I'm sorry. You're comparing
this place to Comic Con?

91
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,447
What- Can I go to the bathroom here,

92
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,404
next to a Wookiee
who got his zipper stuck in his fur?

93
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,408
Wow, we go to Comic Con
for different reasons.

94
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,078
You know... Just...

95
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,506
Get me a copy of Action <i>Comics</i> #1,000,
and I'll be on my way.

96
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,840
Sorry, all out.

97
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,878
Now you just let people
come in and buy them?

98
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,756
Oh, so I didn't realize
your soul was also for sale.

99

Well, it wasn't. But make me an offer.

- Guys.
- Hey.

- Hi.
- So guess what.

107
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,326
That indeed was a comet last night,

108
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,453
and it turns out
no one's seen it before.

109
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,042
- Wow!
- What? Really?

110
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,916
Look at that,
ljust discovered a comet. Oh!

111
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,921
What do you mean, you discovered it?

112
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,502
Well, I'm the one who saw it.

113
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,636
In my telescope, that I positioned.
All you did was look into it.

You both discovered it.

You can put both your names
on the registration form.

- Actually we can't.
- Why not?

00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,805
Because when I filled it out,

118
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,764
it asked for name of discoverer
and I put Rajesh Koothrappali,

119
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:32,022
because, because that's who I am
and that's what I did.

Are you kidding me?

Well, he is the one
who knew it was a comet.

122
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,489
No he didn't,
he thought it was an eyelash.

123
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,572
And you thought it was a fuzzy streak.

124

I mean, do you even know
what a comet is?

125

Yeah. The thing I saw first.

126
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,205

that qualifies as a discovery.

did it discover the comet?

00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,042
We were supposed to
have dinner and romance.

158
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,119
We'll just have to divide and conquer.

159
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,957
I'll go to dinner and you can stay home
with the internet and have romance.

160
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,965
Okay, look, I googled it.

161
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,887
I took the picture,
so it's my discovery.

162
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,472
He stole my comet.

163
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,017
I know. But on the other hand,
do you really care?

164
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,723
Yes, I care.
This happens to me all the time.

165
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,397
People take one look at me and assume
I don't know what I'm talking about.

166
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,891
Mmm, I'm sure that's not true.

167
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,477
I'm sorry, are you saying
I don't know what I'm talking about?

168
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,443
No, I'm not saying anything ever again.

169
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,116
Look, I'm serious.

170
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,943
The other day at work,
I had this great idea.

171
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,074
But no one was listening to me,

172
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,826
and then five minutes later
Paul said the same thing

173
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,326
and they practically
carried him around the room.

174
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,828
Oh, well, what was it?

175
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,751
Well, CPK for lunch
but that's just one example.

176
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,998
It also happens with all the doctors
I have to deal with,

177
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,832
you know, they're so condescending.

178
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,213
I'm so sick of letting this stuff slide.
I found that comet.

179
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,715
Why shall I let Raj say he found it?

180
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,424
I know you're right but he is our friend
and this could be good for his career.

181
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,468
Wait. So you agree with me
but he still gets his way?

182
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,137
There you go. Everybody wins.

183
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,273
My God, you're such a people pleaser.
You can't stand making anyone angry.

184
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,313
Why would I want to make anyone angry?

185
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,190
'Cause it would mean
you were on my side.

186
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,862
Oh, I am on your side.

187
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:26,362
Hey, let's not forget
who you're really mad at here.

188
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,945
Raj. Oh and Paul. Paul sucks, right?

189
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,331
But don't tell him I said that.

190
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,916
Hey, Howard. Did you see the-

191
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:39,996
(EXCLAIMING IN SHOCK)

192
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,670
I'm over here, Sheldon.

193
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:53,347
Oh! That was a close one.
I almost went home with that guy.

194
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,138
You doing okay? Do we need to go?

195
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,932
No, I'm fine.

196
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,859
I admit, all these people
did take me by surprise at first.

197
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,563
But I've learnt that
I can accept change.

198
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,527
Since when?

199
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,280
I managed it when
Amy switched her shampoo

200
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,033
from Prell to Prell for oily hair.

201
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,245
Although, I do miss the way her head
used to slide off the pillow.

202
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,920
- May I help you?
- Who are you?

203
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,051
Oh, I'm Denise.
The new assistant manager.

204
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,592
Nope.

205
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,396
Can you believe it?

206
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,896
In the past decade I have spent
thousands of dollars in that store.

207
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,352
And this is the thanks I get.

208
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,313
You're right, I mean,
he could at least get you a mug.

209
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,113
He gave me a mug.
What do you think I'm drinking out of?

210
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,074
Oh, do you even pay attention?

211
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,622
Honestly, less and less.

212
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,915
Amy, the comic book store is like

213
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,918
my version of the country
in <i>Black</i> Panther.

214
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,876
Okay, I'm afraid this is gonna get
really offensive to certain groups.

215
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,715
But go on.

216
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,181
The nation of Wakanda was a hidden gem

217
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,055
and they wanted to keep it that way

218
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,808
because they knew
if they opened it up to the world,

219
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,231
everything that was special about it
would get ruined.

220
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,933
- Are you done?
- Yes.

221
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:29,235
(SIGHING IN RELIEF) Okay! That both
made sense and wasn't offensive.

222
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,360
And to make things worse,
Stuart hired some woman.

223
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,569
There we go.

224
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,199
Yep. No.

225
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:40,371
I'm not annoyed that she's a woman.
I'm annoyed and she's a woman.

226
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,874
No, I get that.
I'm annoyed and I'm a woman.

227
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,754
It's just, Stuart knows
my likes and dislikes

228
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,710
and I can count on his discretion

229
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,718
if I pick up the occasional back issue
of Superman's pal, Jimmy Olsen.

230
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,427
Which I don't.

231
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,264
Well, don't think of her as a stranger.

232
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,519
Just think of her as a friend
you haven't berated,

233
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,353
lectured or condescended to yet.

234
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:13,408
I hadn't thought of it that way.
Thank you.

235
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,484
You're welcome.

236
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,366
I mean, you're wise
and you smell like books.

237
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,078
You really are the whole package.

238
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,581
Raj, just help me out.

239
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,624
Penny's pretty mad
about this comet thing.

240
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:33,302
Well, I'm sorry she's upset.
But she didn't discover it.

241
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,757
Come on. You know she was a part of it.
Just add her name to the registration.

242
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,217
But I already told everyone at work
that I did it.

243
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,769
My boss was so excited
he started calling me Captain Comet,

244
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,648
which is better than
his last nickname for me, Doctor Donuts,

245
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:50,729
because one time I had two donuts.
And two times I had three donuts.

246
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,742
I guess you're just gonna
have to swallow your pride.

247
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,740
I... I can't do that.

248
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:00,663
Sure you can.
Just pretend it's two or three donuts.

249
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,206
You don't understand, Leonard,
I need this.

250
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,255
My last big discovery was
if you press your upper lip hard enough,

251
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,706
you can block a sneeze.

252
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,002
I told you that.

253
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,931
This is all my fault.
I brought this upon myself.

254
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,018
I'm a bad scientist.
I'm a selfish person.

255
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:26,064
No, no, don't get upset.
You're not a bad person.

256
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,519
Just let me talk to Penny.
I'm sure I can make her understand.

257
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,899
Thank you.
You're a good friend, Leonard.

258
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,698
(SIGHING) I'm glad you think so,
'cause I may be living here soon.

259
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,286
Just look at her, over there.

260
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,871
She just started and
she gets to put up "Staff Picks."

261
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,083
I've been coming here over ten years,
I still can't put up "Sheldon Dislikes."

262
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,964
I talked to her yesterday,
she really seems to know her stuff.

263
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,807
Challenge accepted.

264
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,718
That is not what that was.

265
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,478
Excuse me, I was wondering
if you could recommend something.

266
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,434
Oh, sure.
You wanna tell me what you like?

267
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:12,860
I would not.

268
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,577
All right, well you're wearing
a Green Lantern shirt

269
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,369
so I'm guessing you're a DC fan,

270
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:23,947
although that's from the Alan Scott era

271
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,032
<i>so</i> you're probably not super
into the current run.

272
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,334
How would you
feel about an alternate history

273
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,037
where World War One was fought
with dragons and magic?

274
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,708
That's what I wanted the theme
of my tenth birthday party to be.

275
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,880
Here. Check this out,
it's by Kurt Busiek.

276
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,181
You know, if you're interested
in alternate histories,

277
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,342
Neil Gaiman wrote one called <i>1602.</i>

278
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,436
I'm sorry,
we're in the middle of something here.

279
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,731
It is pretty good, actually.

280
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,853
He takes the Marvel superheroes and
he puts them into Elizabethan England.

281
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:58,315
Let me guess, everyone thinks
the X-Men are the witches?

282
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:00,775
Yeah.

283
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,163
Why don't you take this home,
and if you don't like it,

284
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,078
return it,
and I'll give you your money back.

285
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:09,367
Just don't tell Stuart.

286
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,331
Stuart who?

287
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,795
Hey, where have you been?

288
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,339
(SIGHING) I went to yell at Raj.

289
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,804
And? ls he gonna give me back my comet?

290
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,756
Interesting thing.

291
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,383
Did you cave?

292
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,140
Maybe I did, or... Maybe I did.

293
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,766
But I did realize something.

294
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,568
(STAMMERS) I don't need
to fight your battles.

295
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,613
You, you are a strong
and independent woman,

296
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,611
you have your own voice.

297
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,317
And to quote another strong woman,

298
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,198
Katy Perry,
"It's time to hear you roar."

299
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,452
Did you just think of that
on your way home?

300
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,283
What do you want from me?
The song was on in the car.

301
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,003
But it doesn't mean it's not true.

302
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,836
Well, you make a good point.
I'm gonna go talk to Raj myself.

303
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,594
I know I don't say it enough,
but you go, girl.

304
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:05,469
That was enough.

305
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,686
What's all this?

306
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,140
Well, we missed our date night
and Stuart's working again.

307
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,772
So, I thought we could have
a date night here at home.

308
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,732
Why, that's so sweet.

309
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,486
Oh, so, is that really
what you're wearing to our date night?

310
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,408
Well, Stuart's not here
and the kids are sleeping.

311
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,659
I can wear nothing.

312
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,955
You might wanna hold off on that.
We're starting with soup.

313
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,500
Hey!

314
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,456
Wha- I thought you were
working late again.

315
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,541
I was but Denise has got it covered.

316
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,090
Oh, the funniest thing happened today.

317
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:47,640
You know, the receipt tape
in the cash register, it ran out.

318
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,843
(CHUCKLING) I didn't even know
it could do that.

319
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,059
You know,
we were just sitting down to dinner.

320
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,061
Oh! Perfect timing. I'll go wash up.

321
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,518
There goes date night.

322
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,401
Are you kidding? Stuart's here,
get your purse, we're going out.

323
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,982
What about the dinner you made?

324
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,113
Right. Well, hey, Stuart!

325
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,194
That can of soup sittin' by the stove,
that's for you.

326
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,539
You made canned soup for date night?

327
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,082
And you wore sweat pants. Let's go.

328
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:20,298
Oh, and it turns out
Denise is also really excited

329
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,795
for Dan Slott's run on Iron Man

330
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,343
because he was her
favorite Spider-Man writer too.

331
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,590
How about that?

332
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:31,142
Oh, and guess who goes to
art school right here in Pasadena?

333
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,603
Hmm, I don't know. Denise?

334
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,939
You're a good guesser, Amy.
Not as good as Denise though.

335
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,986
She thought
I would like this comic, Arrowsmith,

336
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,234
and she was right.

337
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,942
Well, was the store crowded?
I bet it was, I know you hate that.

338
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,528
Yeah, It was.
But if it weren't for the crowds

339
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,581
Stuart never would have hired Denise,
and she's the best.

340
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,998
- You must be Denise.
- Oh, yeah. How can I help you?

341
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,879
I'm Amy, Sheldon's fiancée.

342
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,884
Oh. I gotta be honest,

343
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,712
I wasn't a hundred percent sure
you were real.

344
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,216
Oh, I am.

345
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,643
And I heard you and Sheldon had

346
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,265
a great time today
talking about comic books.

347
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,345
We did.

348
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,434
Great, here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna teach me how to do that.

349
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,357
- Do what?
- Pretend to like comic books.

350
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,859
Oh, no. I actually like comic books.

351
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,986
All right, let's not
get hung up on semantics,

352
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,408
it's late, we got a lot of work to do.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

354
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,953
I'm sorry.

355
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:43,585
I haven't even said anything yet.

356
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,837
I know but I heard
your footsteps coming up the stairs

357
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,213
and they sounded angry.

358
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,129
They are angry. I'm mad at you.

359
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,306
And you have every right to be.

360
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,179
Okay. I was... I was being a jerk.

361
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:58,179
We did this together
and I hogged all of the credit.

362
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,107
And after you've been
such a good friend to me over the years.

363
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,901
Like, I wouldn't even be able to
talk to women if it wasn't for you.

364
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,651
So... so, I'm... I'm gonna make sure
that your name is on the comet.

365
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,573
Thank you.

366
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,244
Even if it's
professionally embarrassing, you know.

367
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,742
Or maybe put me on thin ice at work.

368
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:22,288
I may lose my funding.
Still, uh, still wanna make this right.

369
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,371
Good. Bye.

370
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,294
That worked way better with Leonard.

371
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,389
- Hello.
- Hi.

372
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,775
Why are you reading a comic book?

373
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,358
Denise recommended it to me.

374
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,567
<i>It's</i> the <i>Rebirth Omnibus.</i>

375
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,992
She thought it would be a good
entry point for me into the DC universe.

376
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,489
And I have to say,
I really do like how-

377
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,196
You know, Amy... Amy, I've talked
a lot about comic books lately.

378
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,622
Can we talk about something else?
