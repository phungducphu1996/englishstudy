So, Leonard, tell everyone your news.

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,384
I'm starting a book.

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:12,141
That would be big news from Penny,
but you've read a book before.

5
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,396
He means he's writing a book.

6
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,274
I do. It's something I've been
thinking about for a long time.

7
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:23,490
Yeah. It's about a brilliant physicist
who solves crimes using science.

8
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,951
- Oh, Leonard.-
- It's not about you.

9
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,579
- Oh, boy.
- What?

10
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,749
They cast the new Professor Proton.

11
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,700
- Is it Sheldon?
- Not exactly.

12
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,502
SHELDON: Wheaton!

13
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,578
It's Wil Wheaton.

14
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:43,673
Hey, what are you doing?

15
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,800
I thought we were having
dinner at Leonard and Penny's.

16
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:49,095
Oh, no. No, they're watching
the new Professor Proton.

17
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,926
I can't keep Wil Wheaton
off the Internet,

18
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,386
but I can keep him off my retinas.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,314
So you're just gonna sit here
by yourself and do nothing?

20
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,858
I... Of course not.

21
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:01,153
I'm going to write mean comments
about Wil's show online.

22
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,819
Well, you can't criticize
something you haven't seen.

23
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,401
Uh... I'm sorry. Are you familiar
with the Internet?

24
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,279
Well, what if I watch it with you?

25
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,740
Maybe I won't like it, and we
can complain about it together.

26
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,666
Get your own thing to complain about.

27
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,207
Oh, trust me, I've got one.

28
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,752
Look, a-at least if you watch it,

29
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,835
maybe you can find more
specific things to criticize.

30
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,674
Oh, that is a good point.

31
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,301
Criticisms are more hurtful
when they're specific.

Oh, uh, it's my new keyboard. Mm...

It looks and sounds like
an old-fashioned typewriter.

CERN is in Switzerland,

Hey, thanks for being here.

No problem. I'm on my "launch" break.

How could Wil ask Howard to
be on his show and not me?

00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,614
Well, he is an astronaut.

95
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,568
And he didn't start an online
petition to get Wil fired.

Why, why wouldn't Howard tell me?

Well, because he probably worried

that you'd be a big baby about it.

You should talk to Bernadette.

Since she's been on bed rest,
she's binged,

show in India called Karamchand.

He had an assistant named Kitty,

and he was always saying,
"Shut up, Kitty!"

122

Sounds less mean if you say it in Hindi

00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,739
Don't care. Clean slate.
Happy Yom Kippur to me.

130
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,946
I know that you were on Wil's show,

131
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,827
and I know why you didn't tell me.

132
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,037
Do you?

133
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,538
Because you were afraid

134
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,661
that I would be difficult
and annoying about it.

135
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,460
I hope your book has a twist
as surprising as that.

136

It doesn't.

137
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,420
I thought you were
boycotting Wil's show.

138
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,052
Uh... I was,
but I decided to give it a shot,

139
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,724
and I actually enjoyed it.

140
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,973
Uh, just out of curiosity,
how did you come to be on the show?

141
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,180
Did he ask you? Or did you ask him?

142
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,478
Did you just show up on the set
and ring that doorbell?

143
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,359
Sheldon, if you want to be on the show,

144
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,403
you're gonna have to apologize to Wil.

145
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,406
That would be the mature thing to do.

Let's put a pin in that
and keep thinking.

- Ooh.
- What? What? Which part?

148

- Yeah?

151
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,089
Yeah. I have no idea who the killer is.

152
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,011
Oh, great. Me, neither.

154
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,466
So does Penny know
you based a character on her?

155
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,638
What character?

156
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,929
Ilsa, the head of the institute.
That's clearly Penny.

157
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,184
No, it's not.

158
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,352
Really?

159
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,899
Confident, ball-busting beauty

who's always rolling her eyes at Logan?

Trust me, that describes
more women than you think.

162
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,564
(CHUCKLES)

163
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,619
"He looked at the stunning woman
who was his boss and said..."

164
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,995
It's murder.

165
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,120
Figure that out yourself, genius?

166
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,502
Okay, no need to be snarky.

167
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,957
- Who would want to kill him?
- Could be anyone. Dr. Silvers.

168
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,544
Dr. Prakash.

169
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,297
Hans the janitor.

170
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,260
But the door is locked,

171
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,437
so it has to be someone in this room.

172
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,435
Wow, you are on fire.

173
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,357
Maybe it is a little like Penny.

174
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,022
Any chance she'll be flattered?

175
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,232
I don't know. She's pretty mean.

176
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,026
Ilsa or Penny?

177
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,361
Exactly.

178
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,495
Oh, hey, Howard. What's up?

179
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,126
I'm so sorry.

180
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,836
What for?

181
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,626
Hello.

182
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,799
Hello, Sheldon.

183
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,422
I suppose you've come here to tell me

184
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,879
that you've moved me
to your super secret enemies list.

185
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,640
I don't have
a super secret enemies list.

186
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:28,888
I'm not a Bond villain.

187
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:33,309
I'm just a regular guy
with a regular enemies list,

188
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,525
which, by the way, you are no longer on.

189
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,608
Really? Well, that is something.

190
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,448
It's not something that I care about,
but it is something.

191
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,817
He's trying to say he's sorry.

192
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,068
<i>I am.</i>

193
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,326
I watched your show,
and it's really good.

194
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:51,573
Oh, thank you.

195
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,829
And I regret how hard I was on you.

196
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,205
I want you to know

197
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,663
<i>that being on the Professor Proton show</i>

198
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,544
has been a childhood dream of mine.

199
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,507
So, if you're ever looking

200
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,304
for any more scientist guests,
I hope you'll consider me.

201
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,674
Well, I appreciate that, Sheldon,
and I'll keep it in mind.

202
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,513
- You know, actually...
- Yay!

203
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,184
Oh... Uh... No. No. I want to have

204
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,686
more female scientists
represented on the show,

205
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,610
and I thought maybe Amy
might be interested?

206
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,229
(SMALL GASP)

207
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:34,950
You... Or wouldn't it be nice

208
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,500
to have us both on to show

209
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,548
that even female scientists
can land a man?

210
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,633
I said, "Sorry."

211
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,638
So what do you think?

212
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,725
Oh, I like it. I can't wait
to see who the killer is.

213
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,436
Is it that Ilsa girl?
She seems pretty mean.

214
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:06,899
Mm... But adorably mean,
like a baby lion?

215
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,156
No, regular mean, like a regular lion.

216
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,452
But it seems pretty accurate,
considering who you based it on.

217
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,291
Huh.

218
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,620
And who do you think that is?

219
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,668
But the door is locked,

220
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,920
so it has to be someone in this room.

221
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,388
Wow. You are on fire.

222
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:33,842
Oh, you...

223
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,764
Bernadette. Yeah, sure.

224
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,146
Each one of you had a motive.

225
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,562
Who died and made you detective?

226
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,060
He did.

227
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,189
I think you're neglecting
your own motive,

228
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,400
a massive inferiority complex.

229
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,530
It's not massive.

230
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,820
It's just average-sized.

231
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,542
I don't mean to interrupt, but somebody
is tracking blood everywhere, so...

232
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,244
Never mind, it's me.

233
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,964
You say we're all suspects.

234
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,001
How do we know you're not the killer?

235
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,545
I have an alibi.

236
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,715
Yeah. He's not smart enough
to pull off a murder like this.

237
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,554
It's pretty obvious.
Blonde, mean, glasses.

238
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,476
- It doesn't say "glasses."
- Really?

239
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,149
(STAMMERS)
But it will because Ilsa does.

240
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,101
And you know who else wears them?

241
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,728
Bernadette.

242
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,032
And that's her 'cause it's...
It's totally her.

243
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,036
(KEYS CLACKING)

244
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,245
- Oh, Amy. Good, you're here.
- Hi. What's up?

245
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:43,045
How would you like to be on television?

246
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,539
Is it gonna be a news story

247
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,841
where I have to say you were
quiet and kept to yourself,

248
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,463
and I'm as shocked as anyone?

249
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,341
No, it's not.

250
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:56,259
<i>Wil Wheaton</i> wants <i>you to be
on Professor Proton.</i>

251
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,102
That's nice, but I'm not
really interested.

252
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,645
What do you mean?

253
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,598
But he wants to talk
about women in science.

254
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,309
Uh, you're a woman. You're in science.
You go, girl.

255
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,529
I'm all for promoting women in science,

256
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,107
but I don't really want to be
on Wil's show.

257
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,193
Is it because kids may be there,

258
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,654
and they're known carriers
of head lice? I get that.

259
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,332
Sure, that's the reason.

260
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,375
I... Wait a minute.

261
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,045
You're always bragging that lice
aren't attracted to you

262
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,919
because your scalp is so oily.
That was on your dating profile.

263
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,505
Okay, look,

264
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,592
I know you have strong feelings
about Professor Proton,

265
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,594
and I don't want to get
in the middle of that.

266
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,934
So you're not going to do something

267
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,761
just because you think
it might upset me?

268
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,017
Well, it's tricky

269
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,099
because answering that question honestly

270
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,686
is one of the things I tend
not to do because it upsets you.

271
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,771
Well, that's very upsetting.

272
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,108
Like I said.

273
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,995
What other things
don't you do because of me?

274
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,410
Remember last week, when we went

275
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,038
to that dueling piano bar
I was so excited about?

276
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,577
- No.
- Well, now you're getting it.

277
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,841
Boy, I don't know how people
who aren't on bed rest

278
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,590
keep up with the Kardashians.

279
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,054
Well, sometimes
you have to read in your car

280
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,973
while your husband thinks
you're working late.

281
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,641
Speaking of which, he came by
yesterday to show me his book.

282
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,353
Oh, and, and what did you think?

283
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,604
I liked it.

284
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,061
Really? The Ilsa character
didn't bother you?

285
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,605
Oh, he was exaggerating.
You're not really like that.

286
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,364
Well, I know I'm not like that.

287
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,611
The character was based on you.

288
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,120
I don't know what to tell you.

289
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,369
When I brought it up with Leonard,
he said it was you.

290
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,993
Well, when I brought it up, he

291
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,916
got all squirrelly and left the room.

292
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,212
Son of a bitch.

293
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,341
I just learned
some very distressing news.

294
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,639
Sometimes, Amy doesn't do things

295
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,637
because she's worried about
how I'll react.

296
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,261
First of all, it's not sometimes.
It's always.

297
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,022
Second, it's not Amy. It's everybody.

298
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,651
And third, it's not news.
It's well-established.

299
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,863
Yeah. Like, just now,
I wanted to get a croissant,

300
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,065
but I didn't want to hear
you say, "Ooh, la, la."

301
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,286
Uh, so you're saying
everyone walks on eggshells

302
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,658
to spare my feelings?

303
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,455
No, of course not, because we don't want

304
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,248
to hear you complain about
how much you hate the sound

305
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,621
of crunching eggshells.

306
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,087
I don't want my relationship
with Amy to be like that.

307
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,962
Sheldon, Amy knew
what she was getting into.

308
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,385
- You think?
- Yes, we warned her.

309
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,927
Well, regardless, I can change.

310
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,392
- Yeah, of course you can.
- Sure.

311
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,179
You know, everybody thinks
I'm so predictable.

312
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,263
Well, tomorrow,
I'm gonna show up at work

313
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,099
and do something no one will expect.

314
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,192
Wear a baseball cap backwards
to prove your point?

315
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,491
Yes, but which hat?

316
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,111
Gryffindor.

317
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,535
Well, now that you guessed it,
I'm not gonna do it.

318
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,665
Yeah, you will.

319
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,664
Yeah.

00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,014
Looks like the bullet
went right through you.

322
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,888
Damn it, Logan. When are you gonna stop?

323
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,891
Sorry. I didn't get my PhD in quitting.

324
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,232
But you're a physicist. What makes
you think you can solve a crime?

325
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,809
He's losing a lot of blood.

326
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,894
Great. I'm gonna have to clean that up.

327
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,818
You know what? A little soda water
might get that right out.

328
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,908
- We've got to find some bandages.
- No.

329
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,409
There's no time.

330
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,285
Does it hurt?

331
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,370
Everything you do hurts.

332
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,425
Then why do you keep
coming back for more?

(DOOR OPENS)

334
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,142
- Hey.
- So this is what you think of me?

335
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,766
I'm mean, and everything I do hurts you?

336
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,392
What are you talking about?

337
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,145
I know I'm Ilsa.

338
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,476
What... That is crazy.

339
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,061
You-you two are totally different.

340
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,857
- How?
- Well, you... She...

341
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,987
Her name's Ilsa.

342
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,569
You know what?

343
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,991
It's fine. Write whatever you want.

344
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,698
And by the way, Logan Dean
can tell everyone he's 5'8",

345
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,283
but he's not fooling anybody!

346
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,467
Are you sure that's the move
you want to make?

347
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,882
Absolutely.

348
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,179
Okay.

349
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,562
Checkmate.

350
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,890
Oh, I did not see that coming.

351
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,102
That's well played, Amy.

352
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,316
What's going on?

353
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,900
You beat me, and I am responding
with humility and admiration.

354
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,360
What does it look like?

355
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,783
You let me win so you could show me

356
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,456
how emotionally mature you are,
didn't you?

357
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,451
Well, I couldn't wait for you
to actually beat me.

358
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,626
That would take forever.

359
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,046
I'm sorry. It's, uh...

360
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,799
I'm trying to show you
that I can change.

361
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,090
L-I don't want you to miss out
on things because of me.

362
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,467
I know you don't.

363
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,556
You know, and maybe somewhere out there,

364
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,977
there is a little girl
who will see you on Wil's show

365
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,392
and realize that she, too, can grow up

366
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,066
to be a brilliant, amazing,
successful scientist.

367
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,436
Thank you.

Who is really terrible at chess.

369
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:49,031
- Got it.
- No, no, no. I mean, really bad.

370
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,738
What was your queen doing
over there, going shopping?

371
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,124
Well, I mean, I didn't intend
to write about Penny,

372
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,751
but I guess maybe subconsciously I did.

373
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,208
I believe you mean
"unconsciously," dear.

374
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,878
Yeah, sure. You know, it would be nice

375
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,838
if you didn't correct me all the time.

376
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,673
It would be nice if I didn't have to.

377
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,094
Maybe this book of yours is a bad idea.

378
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,689
- What do you mean?
- Well, you're a physicist.

379
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,811
What makes you think
you can write a book?

You're a physicist.

What makes you think
you can solve a crime?

382
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,035
- Got to go.
- I think you mean "have..."

383
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,368
Oh, hey, Penny, good news.

384
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,828
- It's not you.
- What?

385
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,667
Ilsa. It's not you. It's my mother.

386
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,589
I've been writing about my mother!

387
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,843
I think you're neglecting
your own motive,

388
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,386
a massive inferiority complex.

389
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,922
It's not massive.

390
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,049
It's just average-sized.

391

Does it hurt?

00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,065
Everything you do hurts.

395
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,285
Then why do you keep
coming back for more?

396
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,862
Maybe you like it.

What am I doing, writing a book?

WIL: Well, that is our show for today.

400
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,675
And I want to say
a very special thank you

401
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,510
to Dr. Amy Fowler for being here.

402
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,266
It was a real pleasure having you.

403
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,889
And you can feel that pleasure

404
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:45,272
because you don't have a lesion
in your nucleus accumbens.

405
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,229
I really hope I don't.

406
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,819
All right, we'll see you next time!

407
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,111
Amy.

408
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,571
You were glowing.

409
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,823
Stop.

410
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,121
Oily scalp.

411
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,166
I'm so proud of you.

412
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,835
And I'm proud of you.

413
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,258
Because you can't tell how jealous I am?

414
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,336
No, no, no. I can.

415
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,465
But I can tell how hard
you're trying to keep it in.

416
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,178
Really hard.

417
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,602
I'm gonna go to bed.

418
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:21,725
All right, I'm gonna go scream
on the roof.

419
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,477
- Love you.
- Love you.
