1
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,181
What are you doing?

2
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,722
The light is red, so I came to a stop.

3
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:13,431
You're in a stolen cop car
with a dead hooker in the trunk.

4
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,266
You don't have to obey traffic laws.

5
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,940
I know I don't have to.

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,817
The fun is choosing to.

7
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,277
Hey. Missed you guys
at the faculty mixer.

8
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,988
Oh, you should have been there.
Dessert was bananas.

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,864
Sorry, that was misleading.

10
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:33,201
The dessert was pie,
but the pie was bananas.

11
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,961
Actually, the pie was cherry,

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,835
but the taste of the pie was bananas.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,550
Those mixers are such
a waste of University money.

14
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:46,926
If they spend less money

15
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:50,726
on frivolous nonsense and more money
on science, we'd all be better off.

16
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,599
You're a theoretical physicist.

17
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:55,272
What more do you need
than an office and a white board?

18
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:58,525
Someday my new formulas
on entropy decrease

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,773
due to quantum de-coherence
will need to be tested

20
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,729
and that will require funding.

21
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,781
Your theories are pretty abstract.

22
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,735
I wouldn't even know how to design
an experiment to prove them.

23
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,742
Says the experimental physicist.

24
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,659
Well, I know a place the University
can make some cuts.

25
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,993
Bye, Leonard.

26
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,670
One second, he's got a point.

27
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,839
In order to corroborate
your string theory research,

28
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,166
you'd have to create a black hole.

29
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,963
Wouldn't that destroy the Earth?

30
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,594
Well, perhaps.

31
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,013
But we'd all go to the grave
knowing I was right.

32
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,720
I guess you could create
a contained microscopic black hole.

33
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,137
Huh!

34
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,063
Interesting.

35
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,149
Welcome back, Leonard.

36
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,526
Sorry, you're out.

37
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,896
What did I do?

38
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,071
Exactly.

39
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,276
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

40
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,477
Ooh! This one's pretty.

41
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,648
Mmm, my mother wouldn't approve.
Shows too much clavicle.

42
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,901
She calls it "the bosom's welcome mat."

43
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,566
I can't wait to get drunk

44
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,398
and pick a fight with her
at your wedding.

45
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,819
It's just so hard to tell
what will look good on me.

46
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,529
No, this is just to give you ideas,
you know.

47
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,706
Do you want something
simple and elegant?

48
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:36,998
Do you want a train-

49
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,201
Oh! We're talking about trains.

50
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,586
Not the kind of trains you like.

51
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,209
Oh, I like all kinds of trains.

52
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,292
Steam, diesel, coal, elevated, bullet.

53
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,128
Now, I defy you
to name a train that I don't like.

54
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,921
The kind on the back of a wedding dress?

55
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,389
I did not see that coming, good job.

56
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,760
Although, while we're on
the subject of fashion,

57
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,471
lam asking the University
for some funding tomorrow.

58
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,601
What should I wear?

59
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,231
I've got a push-up bra I can loan you
that always gets me free drinks.

60
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,279
How much money are you asking for?

61
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,023
$500 million.

62
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,359
Then I'd go no bra.

63
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,412
What do you need that kind of money for?

64
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,037
I have figured out
an experimental design

65
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,960
that may corroborate
my latest thinking on string theory.

66
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,414
I just need 2,148 high-power lasers

67
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,592
to compress 20 mg of gold
into a small enough volume

68
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,635
to make a microscopic black hole.

69
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,341
- Just nod.
- Mmm.

70
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,889
Sheldon, they're not gonna give you
half a billion dollars.

71
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,888
I mean, they won't even
give me that much

72
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,441
and I keep promising I can make
people's brains grow younger.

73
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:47,728
Can you?

74
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,275
(WHISPERS) No.

75
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,940
But I need it.

76
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,866
It's the only way
to settle the contradictions

77
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,115
between gravity and quantum mechanics.

78
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,913
Well, it's too much money,
you can't ask for that all at once.

79
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,830
Well, what if I ask for it
in six easy installments

80
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:06,004
<i>of $%3,333,333.33'?</i>

81
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:09,508
Okay, what if you asked for $20 million?

82
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,460
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I'm trying to do science,

83
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,508
not hire Lady Gaga
to come to my birthday.

84
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,017
Do you even know who Lady Gaga is?

85
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,390
Presumably the wife of Lord Gaga.

86
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,354
Sheldon, you know, Penny's got a point.

87
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,233
Sometimes when you want
something big from someone,

88
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,815
you gotta to be careful
not to scare them away, you know.

89
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,902
You've gotta start small
and build up slowly,

90
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,079
even if it takes eight years.

91
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,576
Eight long years.

92
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,419
That's oddly specific.

93
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,254
Have you ever done that?

94
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,294
Nope.

95
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,935
So, with this level of high-power
laser array, we would actually be able

96
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,234
to solve the black hole information
paradox once and for all.

97
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,400
That's impressive, and how much funding
were you looking for?

98
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,114
$20 million.

99
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,652
Really? You think you can build that
for $20 million?

100
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,286
Not a chance.

101
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,952
I'm sorry,
then why are you asking me for it?

102
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,663
Because once you've spent $20 million,

103
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,666
you're much more likely
to give me an additional $50.

104
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:32,254
So actually what you're saying is
with $70 million you can build this.

105
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,880
I see why you'd think that, but no.

106
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,925
You can't go to the board of trustees

107
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,427
and say you gave Sheldon Cooper
$70 million

108
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,508
and have nothing to show for it.

109
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,346
No. The only way you'd be
able to save face is to double down.

110
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,561
- So $140?
- And then double again.

111
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,730
$280?

112
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,779
And then good news, not quite,
double again.

113
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,824
So, what do you say? We have a deal?

114
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,653
- He said no?
- No.

115
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,706
That's only a two-letter word.
You're gonna have to double down.

116
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,118
I'm sorry, Sheldon,

117
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,748
but this sort of thing happens.

118
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:13,002
Higgs had to wait almost 50 years
before they built a collider

119
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,458
big enough to prove his theory.

120
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,009
50 years?

121
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,007
But I want to play with it now.

122
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,298
You just have to wait
for science to catch up,

123
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,928
or technology to get cheaper.

124
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,558
Think about DVD players,
they used to cost like $1,000,

125
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,014
but just the other day
I used one to smash a bug.

126
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,606
Yeah, you just have to be patient.

127
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,357
But what if while I'm being patient
someone more relentless than me

128
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,908
badgers their university
into giving them money?

129
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:43,404
If there's someone more relentless
than you, I'd like to meet them.

130
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,448
I would not.

131
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,452
I'm not waiting
for the University to come around.

132
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,712
I'll find another way
to raise the money.

133
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,006
Ooh! If it's one of those booths
where we can throw a pie at you

134
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,503
I'm in for, like, 20 bucks.

135
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,049
Forty bucks if I can throw a DVD player.

136
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,135
Would you like some champagne?

137
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,639
- Oh, thank you.
- Thanks.

138
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:08,720
Sure.

139
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,221
This is nice.

140
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,683
What, helping Amy find a dress
or day-drinking?

141
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,527
It's just nice, okay.

142
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:18,988
What do you think?

143
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,903
Amy, oh, my God.

144
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,234
You look so beautiful.

145
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,069
I feel beautiful.

146
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,201
And look, both clavicles.
Take that, Mom.

147
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,702
You know what they say,
if got 'em flaunt 'em.

148
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,127
Is it possible that
the very first dress is the dress?

149
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,255
No. Don't be silly, you can't buy
the first dress you try on.

150
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,507
That'd be like marrying
the first guy that you...

151
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,808
You can't buy
the first dress you try on.

152
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,848
Little finger sandwiches, too.
This place is amazing.

153
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,398
Interesting thing
about finger sandwiches,

154
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,976
you put enough of them together,
you've got a sandwich.

155
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,025
AMY: Guys, we have a problem.

156
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,314
- Are you okay?
- What's wrong?

157
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,779
I look amazing in all of these dresses!

158
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,621
Look at your waist,
where you been hiding that thing?

159
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,782
Bernadette, stop. (CHUCKLES)

160
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,376
Penny, you say something nice now.

161
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,330
Boy, you know,
when Sheldon sees you in that dress,

162
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,042
he's gonna wanna
methodically take it off, fold it up,

163
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,846
carefully place it in a storage box,
label it, and then ravish you.

164
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,218
Should I try on some more?

165
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,298
Are you having fun?

166
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,510
Am I having fun being beautiful?
Of course I am!

167
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,936
All right, keep going.

168
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,185
AMY: This is it.

169
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,732
This is the one.

170
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,491
Do you love it?

171
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:46,943
Do you?

172
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,947
I do.

173
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,449
Wow.

174
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,874
Also wow.

175
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,884
- Hello, Leonard.
- Hi.

176
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,302
Are you doing anything?

177
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,390
No, I'm just sitting here at my desk
typing on my computer for nothing.

178
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,510
That was my guess,
but I didn't want to assume.

179
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,101
Can you help me
shoot my kick-starter video?

180
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,401
Do you really think people are gonna
give you half a billion dollars?

181
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:23,272
Of course not, but if I can raise enough
seed money to show that I'm serious,

182
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,777
I should be able to attract
some major investors.

183
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,449
And look at the cool incentives
I'm offering.

184
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,035
"For $50,000, I will examine your diet

185
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,708
"and create a customized
bathroom schedule."

186
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,914
That's fitting,
50 grand down the toilet.

187
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,963
How about this. "For $100,000

188
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,841
"I will design the flag of your house
or apartment,

189
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,797
"and for $1 million

190
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,429
"I will come over and tell you
what's wrong with you."

191
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,392
Aw! All these years
I've been getting that for free.

192
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,187
Don't be smug, Leonard.

193
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,939
That's one of things
that's wrong with you.

194
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,940
Well, that was a successful trip.

195
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,024
Yes.

196
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,031
Amy found a dress that she liked.

197
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,785
She sure did.

198
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,036
She found a dress that looked like...

199
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,331
Like it made her happy.

200
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:24,129
She did look happy.
I mean, her face was just glowing, so...

201
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,046
Yeah, we should make sure

202
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,380
the photographer knows to just
really get in there.

203
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,259
So, we agree it's awful?

204
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,308
That dress should be set on fire.

205
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,144
Should we say something?

206
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,349
No, we can't.

207
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,523
Don't you think she brought us with her
because she wants our honest opinion?

208
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,355
No one wants that.

209
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,444
I do.

210
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,533
No, ya don't.

211
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,867
I don't want her to look back
and think she made some awful mistake.

212
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,452
You mean, like your dumb
Cookie Monster tattoo?

213
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,494
See, was that fun?

214
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,543
Someone's gonna say something
and it should be us now

215
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,090
instead of everyone at her wedding.

216
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,422
Okay, but as long as we do it gently.

217
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:09,837
And together.

218
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,175
What about my dress?

219
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,423
Don't you like it?

220
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,094
- I don't.
- It's beautiful.

221
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,991
Hey, Stuart,
I'd like to sell some comic books.

222
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,787
Oh! I know all about that.
Step one is flunk out of art school.

223
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,158
Why are you selling them?

224
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,460
The University is refusing
to fund my experiment,

225
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,333
<i>so</i> I need to raise money
and do it on my own.

226
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,584
How much do you need?

227
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,963
For a start,
I'm trying to raise $500,000.

228
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:55,057
Well, I hope you have that rare Superman
printed on the skin of actual Superman.

229
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,226
I know you're making a joke,

230
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,429
but I really do have
some valuable issues in here.

231
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,388
And this is just the first box of many.

232
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,060
All right, let's see what you got.

233
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,564
Is this a complete run
of Todd McFarlane's Spawn?

234
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,944
(GASPS)

235
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,868
Yes.

236
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:21,412
Ooh! Look at this, Giant-Size <i>X-Men</i> #1,

237
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,956
Len Wein's relaunch of the franchise.

238
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,412
Yeah, I know what it is.

239
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,839
I'm the one who bought it, bagged it,
boarded it and taped it shut

240
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,587
while wearing white cotton gloves.

241
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:34,638
Okay, well, I... You know, I'm gonna
have to open it to assess its condition.

242
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,464
(SIGHS)
Just be gentle,

243
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,970
It's never felt
the touch of a man before.

244
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,972
You don't seem like
you really want to sell these.

245
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,440
Of course I don't wanna sell these.

246
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,476
These are all important to me,

247
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,357
but not as important as science.

248
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,360
And if this is the sacrifice
I need to make, then so be it.

249
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,451
Okay, why don't you
leave these here with me

250
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:57,948
and I'll price them out for you?

251
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,447
Is it okay if I stand here and watch?

252
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,706
Sure.

253
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,540
If anyone asks, tell them I was brave.

254
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,176
Hey, I can't believe
you just threw me under the bus.

255
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,719
I know, right? That was crazy.

256
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,298
Do you know how that makes me look?

257
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:19,925
That's an easy one, bad.

258
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,307
Why didn't you tell her
that you don't like the dress either?

259
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,888
What happened to our united front?

260
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,474
I'm sorry,
is this your first day being a girl?

261
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,567
Oh! Did your mom pack your lunch?

262
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,531
Of course not.

263
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,580
Do you know how much it costs
to pack a tuna fish sandwich in dry ice

264
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,328
and overnight it from Texas?

265
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,835
Well, I do, and my mother says
it's too expensive.

266
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,664
- I like tuna fish.
- Do you want it?

267
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,374
I'll sell it to you for $5,000.

268
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,588
How's the fundraising going?

269
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,632
That depends. Raj, was that a yes?

270
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,213
- No.
- It's going badly.

271
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,848
How much have you raised?

272
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,222
Well, with my kick-starter campaign,

273
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,645
Selling my collectibles
and the money in my bank account,

274
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,518
about $65,000.

275
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,315
Wow! That's a lot.

276
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,562
Not enough.

277
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,774
It's so frustrating
that science should be held hostage

278
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,979
to the almighty dollar.

279
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,615
Don't give up,
you'll find that money somewhere.

280
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,402
- You really think so?
- No, but it's good that he has a hobby.

281
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,863
You ever thought of going to Vegas?

282
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,365
Can you be more specific?

283
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,829
Las Vegas.

284
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,833
Oh! You mean gambling?

285
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,793
Oh, well that's not the worst idea.

286
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,000
Um, it is the worst idea,

287
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,007
and I'm including the year
that Raj wore nothing but tracksuits.

288
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,598
Ordinary people can't beat a casino,

289
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,347
but mathematicians and scientists,
they do it all the time.

290
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,893
A group of students from MIT
took Las Vegas for millions

291
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,393
and that's MIT.

292
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,646
Howard went there.

293
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,980
Come on, Sheldon, I'll give you a ride
out to the desert right now.

294
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,073
No one is going to Vegas.

295
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,242
We weren't gonna make it to Vegas.

296
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,741
Hi, do you have a minute?

297
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,670
Depends, is what I'm wearing okay
or should I go change first?

298
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,505
Look, I'm sorry.

299
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,833
I never should've said
I didn't like your dress.

300
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,669
It's your wedding and all that matters
is that you feel beautiful.

301
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,504
Thank you.

302
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,548
So, are we good?

303
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,347
No. We're not good, you ruined my dress.

304
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,728
What? ljust said you should wear it.

305
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,305
Well, I can't wear it now.

306
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,937
I mean, I know you hate it.
That's all I'm gonna be thinking about.

307
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,642
No, I don't hate it.

308
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,274
I asked if you liked it and you said no.

309
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,856
There is a lot of room
between "don't like" and "hate."

310
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,409
You know, it's where you find
rice pudding and jazz.

311
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,654
Anyway, who cares what I think?

312
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,160
I do.

313
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:52,999
You're the coolest, prettiest,
best-dressed person in my life.

314
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,545
Okay, that would be flattering, except
I know all the people in your life.

Look, Amy, I don't know what to say.

316
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,178
I think I got stuck on the fact

317
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,133
that it's not a dress I would choose,
but it shouldn't be.

318
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,717
You know, it's your dress.

319
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,353
I mean, hey, would you marry Leonard?

320
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,471
Ew!

321
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,774
Okay, a simple "no"
would've been fine, but...

322
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,437
You see my point?

323
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,609
That we're different people.

324
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:21,856
Yes.

325
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:25,239
And from now on I'm gonna remember
that this wedding is all about you.

326
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,113
I appreciate that.

327

It's Bernadette. Hello?

I feel bad about
hanging Penny out to dry.

331
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,754
The truth is,
I don't like the dress either.

332
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,014
Are you kidding me?
Now Bernadette doesn't like the dress.

333
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,806
She is the worst.

Anyone seen Sheldon?

335
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,728
Last time I saw Sheldon
was this morning.

336
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,901
Careful, don't say his name
a third time.

337
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,148
You don't think
he actually went to Las Vegas, do you?

It's better than okay.

344
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:17,041
I am a physicist and I've been
observing this wheel for hours

345
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,918
and running a chi-square analysis,
which is how I know

346
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:24,173
that the ball is far more likely
to land on 32, 17 or five.

347
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,300
So if you could hold off
on replacing this wheel,

348
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,926
I'd like to make several large bets.

Well, good for you. Pelican.

Sir, would you come with us?

No, I have to place my bet first.
This is for science.

'Cause I was gonna return it.

00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,049
Why would you return it?

361
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:10,223
You look like a pile of swans.

I'm so glad you like it,
