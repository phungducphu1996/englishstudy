00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:15,478
It's time.

00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,360
- Did your water break?
- No.

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,187
Are you feeling any contractions?

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,487
No.

6
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,816
Wait. Well, where are you going?

7
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:24,991
To the hospital.

8
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:28,287
Today's my due date,
and this crap needs to end now.

9
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:33,702
Honey, babies don't
always come on their due date.

10
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,832
Halley was two weeks late.

11
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,465
But this baby's a boy.

12
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,675
They don't take as long to get ready.

What are you doing?

15
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:47,135
I'm making the situation better
with humor.

16
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,715
Are you?

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,803
Would you rather me
make it better with magic?

18
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,021
- Go back to sleep.
- Ta-da!

19
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,317
You know, I hear
that sex can induce labor.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,448
Anything for my family.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

22
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,100
I believe today
is Bernadette's due date.

23
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,355
Yeah.

24
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,606
How do you know that?

25
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,521
Easy. 40 weeks from the date
of her last period.

26
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,651
And why do you know that?

27
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,074
Well, excuse me for taking
an interest in people.

- So, any day now.
- Oh, I don't know.

30
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,492
We went to the doctor this morning,

31
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:59,453
and she said it could still
be another week or two.

32
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,289
How's Bernadette holding up?

33
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,381
It's pretty rough.

34
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,341
She's having a hard time.

35
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,504
Why are you smiling?

36
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,556
I had sex twice last night.

37
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,930
That's not fair! She's on bed rest.

38
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,602
She can't run away.

39
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,804
It was her idea.

40
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,640
She read that it can start labor.

41
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,100
Mm, is that true?

42
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:24,403
Well, I would have googled it,
but I was busy taking my pants off.

43
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,316
Yeah, not to brag,
but Amy's last birthday

44
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,027
brought my coital tally up to four.

45
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,330
Whatever you're doing,
it's not bragging.

46
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,082
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

47
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,910
Hey, I was just talking about you.

48
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,208
- Oh, should I ask?
- You should not.

49
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,715
I'm trying to get
our grant proposal together.

50
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,589
Any chance you've finished up
those mechanical drawings?

51
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,512
Sorry. I was gonna do it last night,
but I got kind of busy.

52
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,180
Yeah, you did.

53
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,718
What are they talking about?

54
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:56,893
I'll give you a hint.

55
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,980
It's something
that we have done four times.

56
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,974
<i>Watched La La Land?</i>

57
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,276
(GASPS) What? No. No.

58
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,649
I've not watched <i>La</i> La Land four times.

59
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,613
If you find the soundtrack on my phone,

60
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,862
that's just 'cause
our iTunes accounts are linked.

61
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,281
Looks like I might have
a little more time

62
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,487
before the baby gets here,

63
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,447
<i>so</i> why don't we just stay late
and get it done?

64
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,249
Well, I don't want you
to leave Bernadette alone.

65
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,326
Oh, we can hang out
and keep her company.

66
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,583
- Yeah, absolutely.
- See, see. Look at my Netflix queue.

67
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,165
There's two documentaries
and the movie Friends with Benefits,

68
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:27,792
which I thought was a documentary

69
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,002
about employer health care plans.

70
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,798
Hey, Bernie, it's me.

71
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,596
I let myself in.

72
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,351
Hey.

73
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,387
What are you doing?

74
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,063
I thought you were supposed
to be on bed rest.

75
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,982
That's done, but I've been on stair rest

76
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,900
for the last 45 minutes.

77
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,153
- Here, let me help you.
- Yeah.

78
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,105
If you really want to help,
put on a rubber glove,

79
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,190
reach on up there and start pulling.

80
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,826
I know you're joking,
but I grew up on a farm.

81
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,153
I'll do it.

82
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,739
Uh, ljust want this to be over.

83
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,829
You know, when
my yoga instructor was pregnant,

84
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,329
she told me there are tons of poses

85
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,661
that put her right into labor.

86
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:04,874
I'll try,

87
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,082
but I feel like bendy poses
are what got me into this mess.

88
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,212
Okay, we're gonna start with
some nice breathing exercises.

89
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,547
(EXHALES)

90
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,054
Sorry. I can't think of anything
except how flat your belly is.

91
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,303
Oh, thank you.

92
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,348
Go put on some more clothes, you bitch.

93
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,980
Okay, we go down

94
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,817
and back up.

95
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,038
And back up!

96
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,457
Yeah, hearing you is not the problem.

97
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,504
- Hey, put that phone away!
- Smile.

98
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,634
I'm telling you,
there's an acupressure point

99
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,588
right above your ankle
that can induce contractions.

100
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,510
All right, but just a warning.

101
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,011
My feet are a little swollen.

102
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,685
Oh, please, Bernadette.
I'm sure this... Okay.

103
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,605
- What?
- Nothing.

104
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,308
Your ankles look fine, and not at all

105
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,814
like ljust popped open
a can of crescent rolls.

106
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,824
My mother believes that if
you're not prepared mentally,

107
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,697
it can delay your body
from going into labor.

108
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,157
So what are you trying to say?
It's my fault?

00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,421
Hello.

112
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,379
Let me guess. You're here to
try to get me to go into labor.

113
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,882
Oh, please. I'm disgusted
when people sneeze,

114
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,717
and that's just stuff
coming out of their nose.

115
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,848
No. I am here to sit with you
and keep you company.

119
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,028
I bought it off eBay.

120
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,987
It smells a little like chili,
but all the pieces are there.

121
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,201
Come on, baby.

122
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,534
Get out here right now,
and I'll buy you a pony.

123
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,048
Are there any engineers
on the grant committee?

124
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,256
I don't know. Why?

125
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,051
I didn't have time to figure out
the three-input hydraulic manifold,

00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,388
Hey, ljust wish I could be
there when you present it.

130
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,809
That's okay.

131
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,812
It's more important that
you spend time with Michael.

132
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,938
Who's Michael?

133
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,942
Uh, your son?

134
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,113
No, it's not.

135
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,031
My son doesn't have a name yet.

136
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,614
Okay, well, then, Bernadette's son.

137
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,249
I can't believe her.

138
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,454
She knows I don't want
to name the baby after her dad.

139
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,047
- What did you want to name him?
- I don't know.

140
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,216
We were gonna wait until
we saw what he looked like.

141
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,884
Well, it's a baby.

142
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,547
Her dad's a wrinkly bald man.
That wasn't gonna break your way.

eight weeks of your life.

Sheldon, I said
I didn't want to play your game.

146
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,118
Well, then don't think of it as a game.

147
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,947
Think of it as a source of information

148
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,625
about one of the lesser known
campaigns of World War ll.

149
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,711
You're right. That's so much better.

150
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,131
I know, right?

151
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,543
Okay, first, we need to roll
to determine the weather.

152
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,171
It's a desert. Isn't it gonna be hot?

00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,191
Yes.

Michael? Really, you think
we're naming him Michael?

157
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,035
Not now, Howard.
I'm in the middle of a game.

158
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,539
You wish. You are hundreds
of hours away from the middle.

159

I can't believe you're trying
to hijack our son's name.

00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,894
BERNADETTE: This is as fast as I
move! Calm down!

162
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,771
So you're just gonna name him Michael?

163
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,481
(SCOFFS) Were you even gonna tell me?

164
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,907
I told you.

165
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,154
When?

166
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,819
Oh, right. That was Amy.

167
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,157
What's wrong with Michael?
It's my dad's name.

168
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,744
I don't want to name our son
after your father.

169
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,424
I didn't want to say this,
but he's dying.

170
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,002
He is?

171
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,631
Eventually. I mean, you
see the way the man eats.

172
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,308
Okay, is this the hormones,

173
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,681
or have you always been a lunatic?

174
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,897
I don't even know anymore.

175
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,068
Bernie, this is our kid's name.

176
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,779
I think we should both agree.

177
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,198
You're right. We both made this baby.

178
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,782
Thank you.

179
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,236
And I carried it, had to
stay in bed for four months,

180
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,571
sacrificed my body and my job,

181
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,451
and soon it's gonna
burst its way out of me

182
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,248
like the Kool-Aid Man.

183
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,710
Exactly. Fifty-fifty.

184
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,543
I think I got Bernadette in trouble.
Maybe we should go.

185
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,132
I can't.

186
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,714
She <i>and</i> I <i>are playing
Campaign for North Africa.</i>

187
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,259
She doesn't want to play that.

188
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,638
Neither did the Egyptians,
but that didn't stop Rommel.

189
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,353
Hey! I brought Chinese.

190
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,979
And I brought Indian.

191
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,104
What are you guys doing here?

192
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,282
Sheldon texted and said
Bernadette wanted us all to come over.

193
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,284
The game's best with
five to ten players.

194
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,831
Okay, if it's not Michael, then
what do you want to name him?

195
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,380
Harry, like Potter or Houdini.

196
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,210
It doesn't bother you that I have
an old boyfriend named Harry?

197
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,137
Okay.

198
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,890
How about Al or Max or

199
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,601
Ted or Kevin?

200
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,637
Same answer.

201
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,272
Hey, Bernadette, it's your turn.

202
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:43,193
Uh, Penny's air force
is strafing your supply line in Tobruk.

203
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,312
We're kind of busy.

204
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,898
Oh, okay. But you're being pretty rude.

205
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,279
Everyone did come over
to play this game with you.

206
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,747
You know, I always thought
Christian was a nice name.

207
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,410
I don't know.
Sounds a little too uncircumcised.

208
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,079
Bernadette, it's your turn.

209
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,289
What about Greg?

210
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,965
All right, I'll just roll for you.

211
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,169
Oh, that is a good one!

212
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,675
Your troops' morale rating
is pretty high.

213
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,381
Now, Leonard, as the defender,

214
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,341
we need to subtract your morale rating

215
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,930
from Bernadette's to get a final

216
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,853
adjusted morale rating for the assault.

217
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,977
And I will just check
the assault differential column.

218
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,310
Oh, who said war was hell?

219
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,279
Yeah, that's a rhetorical question.
Sherman said it.

220
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,568
What about Sherman?

221
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,149
Like, Sherman Wolowitz.

222
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,031
Yeah, that's a kid who's gonna
take his mother to prom.

223
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,994
Hey, Howard, you did that, right?

224
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,289
I didn't take her. She chaperoned.

225
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,829
We slow-danced once.

226
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,006
What about Paul?

227
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,256
Paul. Paul Wolowitz.

228
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,383
I like it.

229
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,297
Like "Koothra-paul-i."

230
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,142
Okay, you ruined it.

231
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,268
All right, that moves us on
to the tactical shipping phase.

232
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,191
Penny, I believe,
as logistics commander, that's you.

233
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,939
- Okay. I surrender.
- Uh...

234
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,022
Nice try, Penny.

235
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,232
It takes more
than everybody not enjoying it

236
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,113
to stop a game with Sheldon Cooper.

237
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,570
Sheldon, we're talking
about something important here.

238
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:21,249
(SIGHS) Fine. If you pick a baby name,
can we get back to playing?

239
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,209
- Sure.
- All right, here we go.

240
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,127
Ranatanata.

241
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,706
You can't name him Ranatanata.

242
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,418
Oh, right, it's a boy.
That'd be ridiculous.

243
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,387
(EXHALES) What about Ozymandias?

244
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,966
Are you making these up
or having a stroke?

245
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:42,346
Ozymandias is from a poem
by Percy Bysshe Shelley.

246
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,523
Oh! Oh! Bysshe Wolowitz.
Solved. Back to the game.

247
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,736
Heyo! Sandstorm!

248
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,735
Uh, some people name their
kids after places.

249
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,489
Like what, Walla Walla Wolowitz?

250
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,281
If you think that is better
than Ozymandias Wolowitz,

251
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,082
then you have been breathing in
the poisonous gas

252
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,750
that my troops illegally dispersed.

253
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,870
Oh...

254
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,794
- You okay?
- I think that was a contraction.

255
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,129
Is it time? Do we need
to go to the hospital?

256
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,300
No. We've been through this before.

257
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,844
My water hasn't even broken yet.

258
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,591
Never mind your water.

259
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,673
Has your mucus plug popped out?

260
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,559
Ew, no!

261
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,891
Oh, you're right.
We probably would've heard that.

262
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,851
It's not a champagne cork.

263
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,103
Although that would be festive.

264
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,228
You know what, maybe we should go.

265
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,858
Did you have another contraction?

266
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,564
No. I'm just worried
that Sheldon's gonna say

267
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,365
"mucus plug" again.

268
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,820
And I'm worried
one's gonna hit me in the eye.

269
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,700
Yep, it's time.

270
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,826
Should we take two cars?

271
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,158
Uh, actually, could you
stay here and watch Halley?

272
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,289
That way we don't have to wait
for Bernadette's parents.

273
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,620
Yeah, you guys go.
We'll take care of her.

274
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,955
You have nothing to worry about.

275
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,506
Uh... Well, not nothing.

276
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,755
There are U-boats approaching
the Suez Canal.

277
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,464
It's too late for us. Go, go!
Save yourselves!

278
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,767
Suez? Birth?
It's a big night for canals.

279
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,273
How you feeling?

280
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,851
Eh...

281
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,895
But I am really excited to meet our son.

282
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,986
Me, too. I thought
I'd be super freaked out.

283
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:20,285
But I'm ready for this.

284
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,654
Well, not the part where you're in labor

285
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,035
and you squeeze my fingers
till they turn blue.

286
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,200
I'm sorry.

287
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,877
That must be really painful for you.

288
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,961
It is. I mean, last time, I...

289
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,213
Oh, okay, I see what you're doing.

290
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,509
(CHUCKLES)

291
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,591
(GRUNTING)

292
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,681
It's a big one.

293
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,679
Just breathe.

294
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,933
(EXHALES)

295
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,061
(SIGHS) okay-

296
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,230
Okay, I'm good.

297
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,185
I'm sorry I tried
to sneak the name past you.

298
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,523
That's okay.

299
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,655
I'm sorry I used up
so many good names in college.

300
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,986
I was really competitive
with my roommate.

301
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,536
(CHUCKLES)

302
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,998
Forget about it.

303
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,041
Please.

304
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,914
You know what, maybe we're putting
too much pressure on this.

305
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,589
It doesn't matter what we name him.

306
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,045
He's gonna be amazing.

307
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,593
You're right.

308
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,546
This kid is part you and part me.

309
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,804
Yeah. He's gonna be smart
and kind and funny.

310
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,727
If he cracks five-foot-six,
it'll be a miracle.

311
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,606
I've always liked the name Elliott.

312
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,776
Sorry, can't have it.
That's my boy name.

313
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,611
I said it first.

314
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,484
It's not like calling dibs.

315
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,356
Yes, it is. It's exactly like that.

316
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,113
Dibs on Elliott.

317
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,195
I'm just saying,
we might get there first.

318
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,621
You only have sex once a year.

319
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,573
I'll probably have sex tonight.

320
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,744
Fine, you can have Elliott.

321
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,001
When did you pick out our kids' names?

322
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,128
Remember that day
you moved into the building?

323
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,880
Yes.

324
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,597
A non-creepy amount of time after that.

325
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,676
Yeah, I like the name Elliott.

326
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,510
That wasn't on my list, but I like it.

327
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,601
We've heard your names.
They're ridiculous.

328
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,983
And I have a cousin named Dilip.

329
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,353
Well, I wasn't going to give
them any of the good names.

330
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,904
I'm saving those for us.

331
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,024
Really? You've thought about our kids?

332
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,406
Of course. I think you and I
will have exceptional children.

333
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,449
Oh... Well, I think so, too.

334
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,117
How many kids do you guys want?

335
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,248
- Fifteen.
- Two.

336
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,001
- What?
- Well, don't worry.

337
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,878
I don't expect you to bear them all.

338
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,131
I'm sure we can find a
suitable uterus to rent.

339
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,464
- No!
- Uh-huh!

340
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,050
We weren't thinking about you.

341
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,180
Of course not.

342
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,102
(GRUNTS) I am going to the kitchen.

343
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,555
Can I get anybody anything?

344
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,315
Penny, nice glass of milk
and a multivitamin?

345
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,908
SHELDON: Guys.

346
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,366
Guys, wake up. Terrible news.

347
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,574
Oh, my God. What, what, what?

348
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,002
- Is it the baby?
- No. No, no, we miscalculated

349
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,545
our unassigned armor class units.

350
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,042
We need to start over.

351
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,254
- What?
- No, no, no, not from the beginning.

352
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,880
Just from when the tanks started moving.

353
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,508
That was five hours ago.

354
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:31,434
No. No, that was two hours ago.
It only feels like five.

355
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,262
- What time is it?
- It's almost 2:30.

356
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,809
Don't you think
we should've heard something?

357
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,437
- L'm sure they're fine.
-l'm calling them.

Hell, everything Okay?

<i>Yeah! The baby was born
about an hour ago.</i>

362
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,070
Dude, why didn't you call me?

363
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,330
<i>The only way I would
see my son for the first time</i>

"I need to call Raj"</i>

You know, it can take some time
for pigment to form.

367
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,458
You're still not out of the woods.

368
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,177
- Well, congratulations! Yeah.
- Hey, what'd you name him?

369
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,803
<i>Neil Michael.</i>

370

<i>Neil for Armstrong,</i>

<i>Gaiman, and Diamond.</i>

372

<i>Michael because Bernie
had to get six stitches.</i>

373
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,846
Neil. That's cute.

374

<i>BERNADETTE". But we're calling
him Michael!</i>
